---

## Live Systems

### Coin Economy (Earn-only — 2026-06-27)
- **Balance**: `state.coins` (integer ≥ 0); migrated on load so existing players start at 0
- **Earn triggers**: learning round complete (formula below), world battle win (+10 regular / +15 boss), arcade minigame complete (EggMemory +5, EggTower 3–8, EggRun 3–8 by rings, EggCatch 3–8 by score, EggFishing +5), level-unlock first-time bonus (+15, `coinsLevelBonus` flag prevents re-award), daily login (+10 + streak bonus up to +5 = max +15/day)
- **Round formula**: `coins = clamp(round(12 × accuracyMul × masteryMul), 2, 12)` where `accuracyMul = accuracy < 0.5 ? 0.3 : accuracy` and `masteryMul = 1 - mastery` (mirrors XP decay)
- **Typical daily total**: ~40–70 coins for a 20–30 min session (fresh player higher end; mastered player lower end)
- **HUD**: Gold 🪙 badge in Home header (pixel font, `#FFD23F`)
- **Feedback**: `showItemToast("🪙 +N")` on every award; `showItemToast("ล็อกอินรายวัน 🪙 +N")` on daily login
- **Result screens**: All 16 result/end screens display a gold `🪙 +N` badge showing exact coins earned that round (same value dispatched to `state.coins`)
- **Spending**: NOT implemented yet — earn-only. Shop/items/room planned for next phase.

### Friend Code System (Phase 1.1)
- `FriendsScreen.jsx`: 2-tab screen reachable from BottomNav "เพื่อน" tab
  - **เพื่อน tab** (unified scroll): pending requests (conditional, no empty state) → My Code ("ABC-DEF" + copy) → Add Friend (6-char input + `send_friend_request`) → My Friends list (from `my_friends` view). All loaded in parallel via `Promise.all` on mount.
  - **ผู้คนอื่นๆ tab**: `get_mystery_adventurers({ p_limit: 8 })` → 8 adventurer cards. Each card shows `<EggCanvasCore element eye gender stage aura=0 size=60>` (from `src/egg/EggCanvas.jsx` directly, not the wrapper). Card shows `display_name` + element in Thai + RarityBadge. "ดูสเตตัส" opens portal modal with `<EggCanvasCore size=160>` + 4 StatBars (HP/ATK/DEF/SPD) + "ท้าเล่น" mock (3s toast). "🔄 สับใหม่" re-calls RPC. `drawCreature`/`CreatureCanvas`/`ELEMENT_STATS`/`elementToStats` removed from FriendsScreen.
  - ⚠️ **Migration pending**: `supabase/migrations/20260627_mystery_adventurers_egg.sql` must be run in Supabase SQL Editor to replace the old RPC (currently returns `creature_seed/creature_name/evo_stage`; after migration returns `element/eye/gender/stage/hp/atk/def/spd/rarity_label/is_bot`). Until migration runs, all adventurers will show with default values (fire/gba/male/stage1).
- BottomNav: 4th tab (green dot, "เพื่อน")
- Out of scope (Phase 2+): real challenge backend, friend battles, chat, remove-friend, leaderboards

### Living Egg System (New renderer — 2026-06-26)
- `src/egg/` — 8-layer pixel-art egg renderer with full animation support
  - `eggBaseLayer.js` — round baby sprite (18×18) for ALL stages; `EGG_TINTS` per element; `stageSizeMul` (grows then caps at stage 5); `stageSaturation`
  - `eggEyeLayer.js` — 4 eye styles (gba/tama/sanrio/summoners); female eyelashes+blush via `gender`; dark-body contrast inversion for shadow
  - `eggExpressionLayer.js` — 6 moods (normal/happy/sleepy/angry/sad/excited); brows/mouth/cheeks/extras
  - `eggStageLayer.js` — per-element FX overlay (nature leaf, thunder electric rim, fire particles, water bubbles, light sparkles); mass-body replacements for fire/water/shadow/light (via `drawBodyMass`/`isBodyReplacedBy`)
  - `eggAuraLayer.js` — 5 rarity aura levels; levels 1-3 element-tinted, level 4 rainbow
  - `eggRegaliaLayer.js` — element-themed regalia growing with stage: fire/shadow flame horns, light angel halo, thunder Pikachu-tail horns, nature leaf wings; appears at stage 4+ (tier 1)
  - `eggAnimations.js` — 6 animation states (idle/happy/hurt/attack/sleepy/excited); squash/stretch/rotate pose; ground shadow; red flash overlay
  - `index.js` — barrel export
  - `EggCanvas.jsx` — React component, `requestAnimationFrame` loop, DPR-backed canvas, stage 1-9 rendering pipeline
- `src/components/EggCanvas.jsx` — wrapper reading `eye/gender/element` from `CompanionContext`; accepts legacy `stats={...}` prop (extracts `stats.stage`)
- **All screens now render the companion egg** (not the legacy creature): Home (large display + party bar + background walker), Collection (placeholder), PartySelect, Battle player side, Map player sprite — all show companion `element/eye/gender` with stage/aura from XP progress
- **Companion name everywhere** = `state.name` (the child's account name, e.g. โชแปง); no more `creatureName`/`creature.n` shown
- **`src/egg/renderEggSprite.js`** — new shared helper: `renderEggSprite(ctx, {element,eye,gender,stage,aura,mood,anim,t,canvasSize,basePxOverride})` runs the full 9-step compositing pipeline (aura→pose→regalia-behind→body→regalia-front→eyes→expression) for non-React canvas contexts
- Map player sprite: WorldScreen sets `window.__kq_companionEgg = {element,eye,gender,stage,aura}` on mount; `tileEngine.renderPlayer` calls `renderEggSprite` every frame into a reused 32×32 offscreen then `ctx.drawImage` scaled to TILE(16×16) — **fully animated** (element FX live)
- Home walker (HomeBackground.jsx): single animated companion egg walks/hops/spins; `renderEggSprite` called per-frame into a reused 48×48 offscreen (basePxOverride=2 for larger egg); `companionRef` kept in sync with props; element animations (flames/water/halo) are **live**
- Procedural canvas egg — `eggAlgorithm.js` (**LOCKED**: `drawEgg`, `hash`, `prng` must never change) — still used by minigames (EggRun, EggCatch)
- 9 display stages (ไข่น้อย → ใกล้ฟักแล้ว!!!), adaptive XP threshold (`120 + n×60`, cap 800)
- Pet/feed/item interaction with formal FSM in `useCreatureInteraction.js`
- Tap/swipe handlers in `useHomeInteractions.js`

### Companion Creation (One-time permanent — 2026-06-26)
- `companions` Supabase table: `user_id (PK) | eye | gender | element | created_at` — RLS enforced; no UPDATE/DELETE policy = immutable from client
- `create_companion(p_eye, p_gender, p_element)` RPC — idempotent (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING); `security definer`
- `src/context/CompanionContext.jsx` — loads companion on auth; exposes `{ companion, resolved, loading, createCompanion }`
- `src/components/CompanionCreation.jsx` — blocking overlay (no close, no Esc); live EggCanvas preview + element/eye/gender pickers; Thai UI; confirm dialog "แน่ใจไหม?"
- App.jsx gate: shown for new players AND existing players with no `companions` row; never shown again after creation
- Migration SQL: `supabase/migrations/20260626_companions.sql` — **must be run manually in Supabase SQL Editor**

### Legacy Creature System (STEP 2+2.5+§3+§4 retired — 2026-06-27)

**Deleted files (zero callers confirmed before deletion):**
- `src/components/BattleScreen.jsx` — orphaned; was never imported in App.jsx
- `src/components/HatchOverlay.jsx` — gated behind `!hasCreature` (never fires for current players); removed from App.jsx
- `src/components/CreatureCanvas.jsx` — only caller was HatchOverlay
- `src/lib/drawCreature.js` — only caller was CreatureCanvas
- `src/lib/creatureAlgorithm.js` — only callers were BattleScreen + EggMemory + LoginBackdrop + WorldHUD (all fixed)
- `src/context/creatureHelpers.js` — only caller was HatchOverlay; dead import in StateContext removed

**Replaced with egg art:**
- `LoginBackdrop.jsx` — 9 random element eggs (RAF loop, `renderEggSprite`) replace floating `drawCreature` creatures; tap=squish SFX
- `EggMemory.jsx` — 6 element emoji cards (🔥💧⚡🌿🌑✨) replace creature canvas cards; no creature dependency
- `WorldHUD.jsx` — removed dead `getCreatureSeed` import and `window.__kq_activeCreatureSeed/Stats` assignments (both globals were never read)

**Still present (active callers remain):**
- `src/lib/creatureSystem.js` — keeps `EVO_STAGE_LABELS_TH` (App.jsx evo toast), `determineElement`/`calcEvoStage` (StateContext, state.js progress)
- `src/lib/creatureGenerator.js` — `buildCreatureDNA`/`generateCreatureName` still used by StateContext hatch flow and state.js migration
- `src/config/creatureConfig.js` — `GRADE_LABELS`/`HATCH_CREATURES`/`TIERS` exported via gameConfig.js; `GRADE_LABELS` used across OnboardingModal, ProfileModal, state.js

**DB columns not yet dropped (STEP 3 pending backup + explicit OK):**
- `hatchedEggs` blob in `eggs.state_json` retains creature-identity fields (dna, evoStage, creature.rarity) — harmless; no UI reads them
- `get_mystery_adventurers` RPC migration (`20260627_mystery_adventurers_egg.sql`) **not yet applied** — new shape returns `element/eye/gender/stage/...`; old shape returns `creature_seed/creature_name`; adventurers show default egg until migration runs
- `db_backups/get_mystery_adventurers.OLD.sql` created in repo (git-recoverable) before applying the migration

**Bond meter / evolution** — progress fields (`bondMeter`, `evoStage`, `battleLevel`, `battleXP`) still stored and computed in StateContext/state.js; companion stage (egg size/regalia/FX) is what's shown, not creature art

### Treasure Chest (Map Chests)
- `TreasureSlot.jsx`: question gate → correct → chest shakes (tap to open) → chest opens → items float up → collect
- Rolls home item (55% from food/ribbon/shoes/rainbow_star) + battle item via `rollBattleItem()`
- Items drawn via `drawItem` canvas with glow + Thai label + type badge (สู้/บ้าน)
- `onReward` passes `{ rewards: [{type,key},...] }`; WorldScreen dispatches `DROP_HOME_ITEM`/`DROP_BATTLE_ITEM` per item
- Wrong answer: red flash + close (no retry)

### Post-Battle Reward Chest
- `RewardChest.jsx`: shown after every world battle victory (incl. bosses); phases: closed→shaking→opening→reveal; tap to open, tap to continue
- Battle item drop: 55% chance via `rollBattleItem()` from `itemConfig.js`
- Home item drop: 40% chance from `HOME_DROP_TABLE` (food 50 / ribbon 25 / shoes 15 / rainbow_star 10) in `WorldBattle.jsx`
- Items dispatched immediately (DROP_BATTLE_ITEM / DROP_HOME_ITEM) then chest shows pixel art of each reward
- Navigate-to-world deferred until player taps through chest

### Battle System (World Battles)
- `MoveSelectBattleMode.jsx` (711 lines, refactored) — answer choices = attack moves
- Real HP combat: hit damage = `max(1, creatureStats.ATK − enemy.def) × mult`; miss = SPD/200 dodge + DEF reduction
- Element attack system: 1 random element per battle × 4 tiers (T0–T3 by combo streak); 24 canvas animations in `elementAnimations.js`; `playElementSFX()` 6×4 Web Audio tones
- Battle items: scroll (skip), thunder (15 free damage), gem (double XP), mirror (hint — eliminate 2 wrong), clover (block miss damage). `itemConfig.js` + `PixelItemIcon.jsx`
- Party system: `state.party[]` (up to 4 slots), `PartySelect.jsx` overlay between encounter and battle
- Response time analytics: rolling 50-entry log per subject in `state.responseTimeLogs`
- `WorldBattle.jsx`: wraps MoveSelectBattleMode for world map battles; scales enemy stats via `Math.pow(level, 1.8)`
- Combat logic extracted to `useBattleCombat.js`: fireHit, fireMiss, showVictory, useBattleItem — all refs/setters passed as params, zero behavior change
- **Numpad input mode** (2026-06-18): math arithmetic questions in world battles randomly alternate 50/50 between 4-choice `MoveCard` grid and `NumpadInput` digit-entry (2-digit cap, confirm button, resets per question). `q.inputMode` field set by `genMathQ()`. `NumpadInput.jsx` in `src/components/battle/`.
- **Word-building input mode** (2026-06-18): Thai levels 2–4 and English CVC (level 2) randomly alternate 50/50 between 4-choice and `WordBuildInput` tap-to-spell. `WordBuildInput` is subject-aware: accepts `distractorPool` prop; detects Latin vs Thai via Unicode; uses pixel font + lowercase for English, Thai font for Thai. CVC words split by `correct.word.split('')`.
- **Memory card matching** (2026-06-18): `genMemoryCardQ` picks 3 random alphabet items, creates 6 emoji+char flip cards. `MemoryCardInput` — flip pairs, mismatch flips back, match stays green. Intermediate pairs: `playTone('correct') + spawnEffect('attack')`. Final pair: `fireHit(-1)` → normal question advance. Thai L1–2 (8%) + English phonics (8%). `MemoryCardInput.jsx` in `src/components/battle/`.
- **Fill-the-gap questions** (2026-06-18): `genFillGapQ` shows `[A] [?] [C]` — player picks the missing middle letter from 4 choices. Active for Thai L1–2 (10%) and English phonics (10%). Wrong choices drawn from non-adjacent alphabet positions.
- **Visual discrimination questions** (2026-06-18): `genVisualDiscriminationQ` shows a large target letter; player picks the matching choice from confusable look-alikes (e.g. ก/ถ/ภ, b/d, p/q). Zone 2 renders custom large-char display with gold glow + Thai subtitle. Active Thai L1–2 (10%) and English phonics (10%).
- **Sequencing input mode** (2026-06-18): Thai levels 1–4 (15% chance) and English phonics/cvc (15% chance) may yield a `SequenceInput` question — shuffle 3–4 consecutive alphabet letters, player taps to reorder them. Zone 2 shows 🔤 placeholder. `SequenceInput.jsx` in `src/components/battle/`.
- **Time-based auto-hint** (2026-06-19): if the player hasn't answered within a per-mode threshold (choice/fillgap/visualdiscrim: 4s; numpad: 5s; wordbuild/sequence: 6s; memory: never), a hint fires automatically. Choice/fillgap/visualdiscrim: eliminates 2 wrong choices (same as mirror item). Numpad: shows "💡 ตัวแรกคือ X" below the display. Wordbuild/sequence: the tile hint (gold pulsing border + "👆 ตัวที่กระพริบ" instruction) which was already mastery-based is now also OR'd with `timeoutHintActive`. Guard: timer callback checks `!lockedRef.current && !battleOverRef.current` before firing — no spurious hints if player already answered.
- Canvas particle effects: `particles.js` (beam/orb/lightning/sparks)
- Enemy sprites: `drawEnemy.js` — 9 types via `ctx.fillRect` pixel art

### Map System
- Canvas tile engine: `tileEngine.js` (T constants, GB palette, collision, camera) + `tileMaps.js` (map generators)
- 3 world tiers: Green Meadow (tier 0), Dark Forest (tier 1), Crystal Cave (tier 2) — defined in `worldConfig.js`
- Per tier: 4 regular maps (NW/NE/SW/SE) + BOSS map + secret MAZE map
- Boss unlock: all 4 maps cleared + totalXP ≥ 300; defeat boss → cutscene → next tier
- Secret maze: spawns when `battleWins % 10 === 0`; 30-min countdown; clear for 3 random item drops
- **MAZE fog-of-war**: DOM-based CSS mask overlay. A `<div ref={fogOverlayRef}>` with `background: rgba(8,4,14,0.97)` and a `radial-gradient` CSS `mask-image` creates the transparent circle — the gradient is updated every RAF frame via direct `style.WebkitMaskImage`/`style.maskImage` writes from `useWorldGameLoop`. A second `<div ref={torchRingRef}>` (z-index 3) renders a warm amber ring border at the edge of the lit radius. Both refs are sized/positioned each frame. `drawMazeFog()` is fully removed from `worldDrawHelpers.js`. `fogOverlayRef` + `torchRingRef` passed from WorldScreen to `useWorldGameLoop`. All non-MAZE screens unaffected.
- **Maze entry — glowing purple portal object**: replaces old exit-routing-override mechanism entirely. Portal spawns at a random tile on one of NW/NE/SW/SE screens (saved to `state.mazePortal: { screenId, col, row }`). `drawMazePortal()` in `worldDrawHelpers.js` draws pulsing purple rings + orbiting sparkle particles. Player walks into it → confirm dialog (🌀 "ประตูมิติลึกลับ") → confirm → fade transition to MAZE. Clearing the maze (EXIT_N) immediately spawns a new portal on a random screen. No more 30-min countdown timer or exit-routing override. `mazePortalPosRef` passed from WorldScreen to `useWorldGameLoop` for rendering.
- **MAZE contents**: `generateMazeMap()` now returns `{ map, openCells, entryPos, exitPos }` (was plain array). `spawnMazeContents(openCells, entryPos, exitPos)` populates 2–3 treasure chests + 3–4 `ghost_wisp` enemies on safe open tiles (>2 Manhattan distance from entry/exit). Exit is a single EXIT_N tile at col 18, row 1 (top-right corner), rendered as a purple portal swirl via `drawMazePortal`. `mazeOpenCellsRef` + `mazeExitPosRef` refs held in WorldScreen; passed to `useWorldGameLoop` for exit portal rendering.
- 10 enemy types with movement patterns (patrol/wander/chase/aggro); 30s respawn timer. `ghost_wisp`: maze-exclusive, slow random drift (timer≥70), never chases, never in isChaser list; renders with purple glow + vertical bob (`sin((frame+col*13)*0.08)*3`). HP 30/ATK 3, subject: null.
- **rainbow_star (saiyan mode)**: chasers (snake/baby_zombie/woken sleepy_bunny) stop moving while boost is active; player can still walk INTO a chaser to trigger battle; non-chasers (bouncy_slime/fox_kit/egg_pawn/leaf_sprite/mushroom_imp) are unaffected. Fast rainbow hue-cycle glow on world-map player sprite (HSL hue 0→360 per 60 frames). `powerup` SFX plays on activation.
- World HUD (WorldScreen.jsx): mini-map + creature status + XP bar + battle items + item bag + home button
- Treasure chests: `TreasureSlot.jsx` slot machine overlay with gate question; `PixelItemIcon.jsx`
- Screen transitions: 160ms fade; player position restored after battle (`state.worldPosition`)

### Learning System
- 3 subjects, mastery-based unlock (≥80% accuracy EMA):
  - **Thai** — 5 levels: letter match, spell ×3, word-order
  - **Math** — 9 levels: L0 count, L1–L5 add/sub/mixed, L6 word-problems, L7 comparison, L8 patterns AB
  - **English** — 4 levels: phonics, CVC, sight words, sentence ordering
- Math visual models: L1/L2 = emoji objects grid; L3 = ten-frame; L4 = cross-out; L5+ = dot visualization
- Teach overlay (first time per level), GameHeader (progress + streak), hint system (amber highlight / reveal)
- Battle subject routing: `battleSubject.js` — strict thai→math→eng rotation with `notready` override
- **Adaptive difficulty system** (2026-06-16):
  - `state.subjectLevels` drives actual battle level (replaces `getBattleLevel()` rotation)
  - After each non-boss battle: `isStrong = accuracy≥80% AND questions≥6`; 3 consecutive strong → level up + cutscene
  - Accuracy <50% AND questions≥6 → silent level down (clamped to `subjectLevelFloor`)
  - Level up dispatches `SET_PENDING_LEVEL_UP` → `LevelUpCutscene.jsx` global overlay shows
  - `LevelUpCutscene.jsx`: flash→reveal→celebrate→done phases; canvas star rain; tap to continue → navigate('world')
  - Map sky tint shifts by subject level: L1=dawn, L2=golden, L3=sunset, L4+=dark (CSS rgba overlay, 3s transition)
  - `WorldBattle.jsx` uses `accuracyRef` (correct/total) — `scoreRef` preserved for backward compat only
- **Grade system** (updated 2026-06-16): `state.grade` computed from avg subject level in `SET_SUBJECT_LEVEL` reducer: avg≥2→grade1, avg≥3→grade2, avg≥4→grade3; grade only advances; creature evoStage updated immediately on grade change via `calcEvoStageInline()`
- **PROGRESSION_MAP** (2026-06-16) — `battleConfig.js` — unified tier/evo/egg system:
  - 5 tiers: อนุบาล (L1) → ป.1ต้น (L2) → ป.1ปลาย (L3) → ป.2 (L4) → ป.3+ (L5)
  - `readyToHatch` set when grade advances and hatchedEggs < 6
  - `calcEvoStage()` reads PROGRESSION_MAP evo thresholds: teen (Lv≥11, Tier≥1); final (Lv≥26, Tier≥3, Bond≥60)
  - `calcEvoStageInline()` in StateContext.jsx for reducer use (avoids circular import)
- `subjectReadiness.js` shared utility: 4 states (Strong/Comfortable/Exploring/Not Ready)

### Home Screen (`Home.jsx`, ~969 lines)
- `HomeBackground.jsx` canvas: pixel scene (sky, mountains, ground, sun/moon, clouds, butterflies, bird, fireflies) + animated creature entities
- Egg zone: large EggCanvas (190×225px), floating + aura. Post-session growth banner when `sessionXP > 0`
- Creature zone: large 160×160 `drawCreature` canvas (tap/swipe for bond), party portrait bar (56×56 per creature, gold border on active)
- Item tray: food/ribbon/shoes/rainbow_star; cooldown status from `state.activeBoosts`; active/cooldown overlays; saiyan rainbow hue-cycle animation on creature canvas when rainbow_star active (CSS `.saiyan-rainbow` class on wrapper div — `@keyframes rainbow-cycle` 0.6s hue-rotate); activation plays `powerup` SFX + `celebrate` tone
- HatchOverlay biography phase (`bio`) before egg tapping when active creature has adventures
- Creature companion tap: `handleCreatureTap` (+1 bond + bounce + emoji reaction); 3 swipes = +3 bond + 💖

### Collection Screen (`Collection.jsx`)
- CreatureJourney: evolution roadmap shown under each party creature card; ○/⚡/✅ per step (teen/final); shows Lv, Tier, Bond requirements; BABY→TEEN→FINAL stage bar
- 2 tabs: ทีม (party with HP bars + level + ★ ตัวหลัก badge) + กระเป๋า (ItemBag)
- ItemBag: two sections — "ไอเทมดูแลครีเอเจอร์" (homeItems: food/ribbon/shoes/rainbow_star) + "ไอเทมในการสู้" (battleItems: scroll/thunder/gem/mirror/clover); divider between sections; `drawItem` canvas per slot; count badge; dimmed when count=0
- Pixel art header: "COLLECTION" in font-pixel yellow; dark background matching Home screen
- Creature cards: 90×90 pixel art `drawCreature` canvas per creature
- `CreatureDetailPopup.jsx`: 120×120 pixel art canvas + element glow, Level + evo stage, ATK/DEF/SPD/HP grid, bond meter bar, born-stats XP bars

### Report Screen
- Pixel art dark theme (matches Home/Collection)
- Section 1: Overview stats — mins played, rounds passed, accuracy %, streak
- Section 2: Subject XP bars (Thai/Math/Eng) with readiness label from `computeReadiness()`
- Section 3: LEVEL · GRADE — `SubjectLevelCard` per subject; header shows current level name + grade badge; tap expands full level table with ✓/►/· status icons per level
- Section 4: Response speed per subject — avg seconds + trend arrow (only when ≥5 logs)
- Section 5: Parent Report — natural Thai sentences generated from real data
- Section 6: "ควรเล่นอะไรต่อ" — actionable suggestion based on weakest subject + streak
- `SUBJECT_LEVEL_MAP` in Report.jsx: 5 Thai levels, 9 Math levels, 4 Eng levels each with Thai grade label (อนุบาล/ป.1/ป.2)

### Item System
- `state.homeItems`: food/ribbon/shoes/rainbow_star — used on Home screen; affect HP/activeBoosts
- `state.battleItems`: scroll/thunder/gem/mirror/clover — used in battle; drop 10% on victory, 55% from treasure chests
- `state.activeBoosts`: persisted boost state (ribbon/shoes/rainbow_star) with `endsAt` timestamp; ribbon/shoes/rainbow_star boosts stored here after use
- ACTIONS: USE_HOME_ITEM, USE_BATTLE_ITEM, DROP_HOME_ITEM, DROP_BATTLE_ITEM (backward-compat USE_ITEM/DROP_ITEM aliases remain)
- localStorage migration: old `items{}` → homeItems/battleItems; star→rainbow_star, potion→shoes on load
- HOME_ITEMS config in `itemConfig.js` with duration/cooldown per item
- itemArt.js: pixel art for shoes (orange sneaker) + rainbow_star (multicolor 8-arm star)

### Audio
- BGM: `playBGM(track)` / `stopBGM()` — 4 tracks (home/world/battle/victory) via Web Audio API
- SFX: `playSFX(name)` — 19 named sounds; iOS `touchstart` resume
- TTS: Web Speech API — Thai (`speakTh`), English (`speakEn`), math Thai number words
- Creature voice: `playCreatureSound(voiceProfile, moment)` — 5 families, pitch-shifted per DNA
- Static `.m4a` phonics files in `public/sounds/phonics/`

### Minigames (5, lazy-loaded)
| Game | Unlock | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| EggRun | daily (10 rounds) | Endless runner, 3 lives/day |
| EggCatch | 2 hatched eggs | Catch items, dodge rocks |
| EggMemory | 4 hatched eggs | Match pairs of creature canvases |
| EggTower | 6 hatched eggs | Stack blocks |
| EggFishing | 10 hatched eggs | Timing-based fish for items |

### Persistence & Auth
- localStorage key `kq_state` — always-on, written every state change
- Supabase `eggs` table: `user_id, child_name, state_json, updated_at`
- **Mandatory login** — app fully blocked behind email/password auth; no guest mode
- **Onboarding gate** — new accounts must set name + schoolGrade + gender before app is accessible; `state.name === ''` is the trigger
- `state.schoolGrade` — parent-entered label string (e.g. "ป.1"), informational only, does not affect game progression
- `state.gender` — `'male' | 'female' | 'unspecified'`
- `state.stateVersion` — schema version (currently 1); `migrateStateShape()` deep-merges new nested fields on load
- `state.lastSavedAt` — timestamp used for cloud conflict resolution (replaces `rounds` counter)
- `resolveSync(local, remote)` — single source of truth for cloud conflict resolution in `state.js`
- `SaveStatusIndicator.jsx` — fixed bottom-right badge showing saving/saved/error/offline via pub/sub (`onSaveStatusChange`)
- Logout: `supabase.auth.signOut()` + `localStorage.removeItem(KEY)` + `dispatch(INIT, defaultState())` — fully clears local state
- `_migrateBattleStats()` backfills all new fields for legacy eggs on load
- One-time migration flags: `_subjectLevelCalibrated` (recalibrate subjectLevels from levelMastery), `_itemsMigrated` (additive items→homeItems/battleItems merge), `_evoRechecked` (recheck all creature evoStage on load)

### Auth UI
- `LoginBackdrop.jsx` — interactive animated gradient backdrop: 9 tappable creature sprites (squish or temporary evolve on tap), looping 8-note BGM via `startBGM()`/`stopBGM()`, central pixel-art sword "เริ่มเล่น!" start button that opens LoginModal via `onStartTap` prop
- `LoginModal.jsx` — email/password login + sign-up + forgot-password flow; `mandatory` prop disables dismiss + hides ✕ button; pixel-art styling
- `ResetPasswordModal.jsx` — catches `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` Supabase event; two-field password reset
- `OnboardingModal.jsx` — name + schoolGrade + gender picker; cannot be skipped; pixel-art styling
- `ProfileModal.jsx` — name/grade/gender edit + logout; pixel-art styling
- All three modals use `px-auth-sheet` / `px-auth-input` / `px-btn` from the pixel CSS system

### Config Architecture (2026-06-16 refactor)
`gameConfig.js` is a barrel re-exporting from focused split files. All existing imports unchanged.

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `creatureConfig.js` | `HATCH_CREATURES`, `GRADE_LABELS`, `CREATURE_LEVELS`, `TIERS`, `calcCreatureStats()` |
| `battleConfig.js` | `BOSS_XP_THRESHOLD`, `AI_OPPONENTS` |
| `mapConfig.js` | `MAP_THEMES` |
| `gameConfig.js` | All learning content (ITEMS, TH_ALPHA, LEVELS, TEACH_CONTENT, etc.) + barrel re-exports |

### Visual System
- Pixel font: Press Start 2P (EN/numbers), Sarabun (Thai), Mitr/Fredoka One (headings)
- 16-color pixel palette + CSS variable library (`--px-*`) in `styles.css`
- Pixel class library: `px-box`, `px-btn`, `px-hp-bar`, `px-answer-card`, `px-dialogue`, `px-auth-sheet`, `px-auth-input`, etc.
- `image-rendering: pixelated` on all `img,canvas`; square corners everywhere
