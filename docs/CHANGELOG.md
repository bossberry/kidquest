## 2026-06-10 — Procedural Character System Phase 3: Creature Personality & Animation

- `src/lib/drawCreature.js` — `drawCreature(canvas, dna, anim={})` now accepts optional animation state. `drawEyes` applies `blinkAmt` (0=open, 1=closed): scales eye y-radius by `1 - blinkAmt * 1.25`; below `bScale < 0.12` draws gentle closed-eye curve; crescent/button eye types squash via `ctx.save/translate/scale`. New `drawSleepZ(ctx, G, C, particles, sc)` draws floating 'z' glyphs using accent hue. Commit `658d25c`.
- `src/components/CreatureCanvas.jsx` — Full rewrite. RAF animation loop drives blink state machine (`open → closing → closed → opening`) with personality-specific rate and ±1s jitter. Sleep Z-particle system: spawn/float/fade particles passed to `drawCreature` as `sleepParticles`. Props added: `personality`, `animationEnabled` (default `true`), `idleMode` (`'idle'|'sleep'|'celebrate'`). CSS idle class derived from personality + idleMode applied to canvas element. Commit `658d25c`.
- `src/styles.css` — 8 CSS keyframe sets (`ci-happy`, `ci-curious`, `ci-brave`, `ci-playful`, `ci-gentle`, `ci-sleepy`, `ci-shy`, `ci-celebrate`) and matching animation classes. Each keyframe combines breathing (scale) + body bob (translateY) tuned per personality speed. `@media(prefers-reduced-motion:reduce)` disables all `ci-*` classes. Commit `658d25c`.

## 2026-06-09 — Procedural Character System Design v3 (Egg-to-Creature Identity)

- `docs/research/creatures/procedural-character-system.md` — NEW SECTION: **Egg-to-Creature Identity**. Core rule: family derived from egg visual motif first; stats modify creature within that family. Motif detection logic (isNight → Moon; ha gold + streak ≥ 14 + stage ≥ 5 → Star; h1 hue ranges → Leaf/Ocean/Cloud/Crystal/Ember). Motif catalog (7 named motifs with visual descriptions). Family mapping from egg motif with named examples (Moon Fox / Moon Bunny / Moon Puff / Moon Dragon / Star Puff / Star Bird / Star Cat / Leaf Bear / Ember Fox / Ember Dragon, etc.). Concrete inheritance examples table. Updated Family Determination Logic (motif-first, stat-fallback for no-motif eggs). Updated Egg-to-Creature Visual Continuity section (now references Identity section, adds motif row to hard-continuity table). Future note: Egg Visual Identity Pass may require CSS overlay or planned `drawEgg()` modification so eggs look more clearly motif-typed. Open questions expanded to 10 (Q9: egg legibility, Q10: Ember as 17th family).
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — Egg-to-Creature Identity section added; open questions updated to 10.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — Design v3 task marked done; GPT questions updated to 10.
- No code changes. No build.

## 2026-06-09 — Procedural Character System Design v2 (Beauty Layer + Families + Migration)

- `docs/research/creatures/procedural-character-system.md` — REVISED. Added: **Beauty Layer** (between Art Direction and Animation — sticker test, tinted outline, eye gloss, body radial gradient, cheek gradient, signature feature amplification, harmony check, breathing room, collection background aura). Added: **16 Family Archetypes** (Puff/Fluff/Bear/Cat/Fox/Bunny/Bird/Dragon/Leaf/Star/Moon/Cloud/Crystal/Ocean/Flower/Dream — visual themes not species; family determined first; 2–3 locked features per family; sibling relationship). Added: **Signature Feature System** (17 traits: mega-cheeks, two-color-eyes, heart-cheek, star-freckle, mega-ears, curly-tail, twin-tails, large-bow, body-glow-spot, etc.; one per creature; amplified by Beauty Layer; has own idle micro-animation). Added: **Existing Collection Migration** section (old emoji creatures → legacy render path; new hatches → `dna` field → canvas; same seed = same character forever; no data loss). **Removed Phase 2 emoji-composite** from implementation path. New **5-phase path**: P1 DNA extraction → P2 drawCreature() canvas → P3 Animation → P4 Voice → P5 Birth sequence. Updated combination math: ~340M valid creatures. Updated open questions: 8 questions, Q1 (canvas vs emoji-composite) resolved by removing emoji composite.
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — Procedural Character System section updated with revised architecture, new decisions (Beauty Layer, families, signature features, migration), 5-phase path, 8 open questions.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — Design v2 task marked done; emoji-composite Phase 2 task replaced with Canvas renderer task; Phase 3–5 tasks updated.
- No code changes. No build.

## 2026-06-09 — Procedural Character System Design

- `docs/research/creatures/procedural-character-system.md` — NEW. Full architecture for infinite creature generation without fixed monster pools. Core: re-uses `hash()` + `prng()` from `eggAlgorithm.js` (imported, never modified) to derive creature DNA from egg stats. 40+ gene attributes (body/face/ears/horns/wings/tail/pattern/accessories/glow). Art direction layer enforces cute/warm/huggable constraints for ages 4–6. 7 personality types (Happy/Curious/Brave/Playful/Gentle/Sleepy/Shy) derived from learning profile at hatch time. Animation + voice layers. Egg-to-creature visual continuity (same hue values carry over; 60–75% feature echo probability). Feature richness scales by hatch stage. ~42M valid combinations. 4-phase implementation path. 10 open questions for GPT.
- `docs/RESEARCH_INDEX.md` — Creatures section added.
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — Procedural Character System section with key decisions and 7 GPT open questions.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — Design task done; Phase 1–4 implementation tasks added.
- No code changes. No build.

## 2026-06-09 — Dramatic Egg Stage Progression

- `src/lib/eggAlgorithm.js` — `EGG_STAGES` changed 7→9. `EGG_STAGE_NAMES` updated to 9 Thai names: ไข่น้อย / ไข่อบอุ่น / ไข่มีความสุข / ไข่แวววาว / ไข่วิเศษ / ไข่เปล่งแสง / ไข่โบราณ / ไข่แตกร้าว / ใกล้ฟักแล้ว!!!. `drawEgg()`, `hash()`, `prng()` untouched — visual spread naturally adjusts via `progress = stage/8` (was `stage/6`).
- `src/lib/audio.js` — 2 new SFX: `stageUp` (5-note ascending triangle fanfare + 2 sine accents); `heartbeat` (two-beat lub-dub low sine, 90→38Hz).
- `src/styles.css` — 9 `@keyframes egg-aura-s*` (s2–s8) with pulsing `drop-shadow` growing in intensity/frequency per stage. 9 `.egg-s*` classes apply persistent aura on EggCanvas. `@keyframes stage-up-pop` + `.stage-up-banner` for pop/float/fade celebration overlay.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — `EGG_STAGES` imported. `stageUp` state + `prevStageRef` for stage-up detection. Stage-up `useEffect`: detects stage increase → `stageUp` sound + 18 sparkle + 6 heart particles + `.stage-up-banner` overlay (2.8s, auto-clear). Heartbeat `useEffect`: plays `heartbeat` once + every 8s when `readyToHatch`. `readyToHatch` updated to `stage >= EGG_STAGES - 1`. Excited mode threshold updated 5→7. `stageDots` uses `EGG_STAGES` constant (was hardcoded 7). `EggCanvas` gets `egg-s${stage}` class (merged with temp `egg-glow-*` — glow overrides aura during interactions). Stage header: 9-color dot+name tints per stage, smaller dots (7px, was 9px), color transitions on stage change.
- Build ✅. Commit: `feat: dramatic egg stage progression`. Pushed.

## 2026-06-09 — Egg Home Emotional Life

- `src/components/Home.jsx` — New idle behaviors: `idle-blink` (fast Y-squish, ~blink), `idle-look` (gentle tilt, curious), `idle-yawn` (slow stretch + settle) added to the 5–12s random idle pool. Creature companion gains personality state machine (walk/wave/sit/celebrate/gift/look/sleep, 20–45s cycle): `wave` → creature bounces + 👋 inline + chirp sound; `sit` → tilted 14° + static; `celebrate` → jump loop + 🎊 + sparkle particles + celebrate sound; `gift` → 🎁 shown; `look` → 👀 shown; `sleep` → dim opacity + 💤. Creature patrol pauses during non-walk states. Directional flip wrapped separately from animation class so they don't conflict. Ambient events: butterfly 🦋, falling leaf 🍂, shooting star ✨ — `position:fixed` CSS animations, triggered every 38–88 seconds, visual only, no mechanics. Reunion enhanced: hearts+sparkle combined burst + double chirp. Ribbon: changed from `pet` to `happy-spin` (proud spin). Star: combined sparkle+hearts burst.
- `src/lib/audio.js` — Added `yawn` sound: low descending sine (290→165Hz, 0.94s).
- `src/styles.css` — 12 new keyframes/classes: `idle-blink`, `idle-look`, `idle-yawn`, `creature-wave`, `creature-celebrate`, `creature-overlay-bob`, `ambient-butterfly`, `ambient-leaf`, `ambient-shooting-star` + CSS classes for new idle and creature animations.
- Build ✅. Commit: `feat: egg home emotional life`. Pushed.

## 2026-06-09 — Home Bottom Layout Overlap Fix

- `src/styles.css` — Added `#root { height:100%; width:100%; display:flex; flex-direction:column; overflow:hidden }`. This fixes the height propagation chain (html→body→#root) so that `height:100%` on children resolves correctly. Also increased `#egg-home` padding-bottom from `calc(60px + safe)` to `calc(76px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` — actual nav height is 95px (61px buttons + 34px safe area), previous value was 94px (1px short).
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — Changed root div `height:'100%'` → `height:'100dvh'` and split `overflow:'hidden'` → `overflowX:'hidden', overflowY:'hidden'`. `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height) works independently of the parent height chain and adjusts correctly for iOS Safari's retractable browser toolbar. Belt-and-suspenders with the #root CSS fix.
- Build ✅. Commit: `fix: home bottom layout overlap`. Pushed.

## 2026-06-09 — Egg Home Emotional Polish

- `src/components/Home.jsx` — Full rewrite. Flying food animation (fixed-position emoji flies from tray up to egg center, egg eats it). Per-item glow effects via CSS `drop-shadow` on EggCanvas (`egg-glow-warm/blue/gold/pink`). Ribbon 🎀 overlay (persists on egg after use, top-right corner). Star orbit: two `.egg-star-orbit` divs rotating around egg when XP boost active. Random idle micro-animations: every 5–12s, `idle-wiggle` or `idle-jump` fires (25% chirp, 8% begging sound) — egg feels alive without interaction. `stageRef` + `eggAnimRef` fix stale closure in `triggerAnim` and idle scheduler. Food chain: flyingItem set → 360ms → eat anim + chew sound + warm glow → 620ms: flyingItem clear → 870ms: sigh sound. Ribbon: jingle + pink glow + pet anim. Potion: slurp + blue glow + relax anim. Star: celebrate + gold glow + happy-spin. Pet streak 3 → giggle sound. Layout: inline `paddingBottom:66` removed; CSS `#egg-home` rule handles safe-area-aware padding.
- `src/lib/audio.js` — 6 new SFX: `chew` (3-hit crunch), `slurp` (rising sine + accent), `giggle` (4-step ascending triangle pairs), `sigh` (descending sine fade), `celebrate` (6-note ascending fanfare), `begging` (rising-falling sine breath).
- `src/styles.css` — EGG HOME section expanded: `egg-anim-eat`, `egg-anim-relax`, `egg-anim-idle-wiggle`, `egg-anim-idle-jump`, `food-fly-up`, `egg-glow-warm/blue/gold/pink`, `star-orbit` keyframes and classes. Layout: `#egg-home` `padding-bottom: calc(60px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` fixes iPhone safe area overlap.
- Build ✅. Commit: `feat: egg home emotional polish`. Pushed.

## 2026-06-09 — Egg Home MVP

- `src/components/Home.jsx` — REPLACED. Old Home (Adventure Director, subject grid, Egg Run, stats strip) removed. New Egg Home: large egg center (190×225px), idle float animation, stage 5+ excited pulse, pet interaction (chirp+sparkle+hearts), streak happy-spin + sleepy, reunion burst on first visit or >4h gap, item tray (food/ribbon/potion/star, count badges, tap-twice-to-use), creature companion walks left-right after first hatch (tap for chirp+bounce), action row (ลูบไข่ / คอลเลกชัน / ออกสำรวจ), warm gradient background.
- `src/lib/state.js` — Added `lastHomeVisit: null` to `defaultState()`.
- `src/context/StateContext.jsx` — Added `UPDATE_LAST_HOME_VISIT` action + reducer case.
- `src/lib/audio.js` — Added 4 new SFX to `playTone()`: `chirp` (high cute chirp), `sparkle` (ascending twinkle), `jingle` (ribbon jingle), `feed` (eating sound).
- `src/styles.css` — Added Egg Home keyframes: `egg-home-float`, `egg-home-excited`, `egg-anim-pet`, `egg-anim-happy-spin`, `egg-anim-reunion`, `egg-anim-sleepy`, `particle-rise`. Added CSS classes: `.egg-anim-float/excited/pet/happy-spin/reunion/sleepy`.
- Build ✅. Commit: `feat: egg home mvp`. Pushed.

Covers: screen layout (390px portrait), egg zone (160–200px center, stage-aware appearance), item tray interactions (pet/feed/ribbon/potion/star with distinct visual rituals), mood system (happy/content/quiet/excited/reunion — visual only, no stat bars), stage progression in Home (stages 1–7 with distinct egg behaviour), creature companion (walks left-right, tap for reaction), return loop motivators (intrinsic only: reunion burst, near-hatch excitement, items waiting), Year 1 MVP scope, 10 open questions for GPT.
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — Egg Home Design section added at top.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — Egg Home design task marked done; GPT open questions task added.
- `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` — Updated.
- `docs/GPT_HANDOFF.md` — Latest session summary updated.
- No code changes. No build.

## 2026-06-09 — KidQuest World Design (docs only)

- `docs/research/world/kidquest-world.md` — NEW. Full design document for the world-based game model. Covers: philosophy shift (game-first, learning hidden), Chopin's direct playtesting feedback ("boring" / "not like a game"), emotional center (egg is the hero), high-level loop (Egg Home → explore → encounter → battle → reward → grow → hatch), Egg Home spec, World Map structure (screen-based, Pokémon FireRed model), region list (Year 1 = Green Meadow only), exploration events, battle's new role, learning hidden curriculum principle, transition from current state, Year 1 MVP scope, 10 open questions for GPT.
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — KidQuest World section added at top. Records: Chopin's feedback, philosophy decision, emotional center decision, high-level loop, map structure decision (screen-based), Year 1 scope (Green Meadow), 10 open questions, what Claude Code must NOT touch until GPT answers.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — KidQuest World design phase tasks added at top of Now section: world doc (done), GPT open questions (pending), Egg Home design, World Map design, Encounter design, implementation queue (blocked on design).
- `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` — Updated.
- `docs/GPT_HANDOFF.md` — Updated with new session summary and revised current state.
- No code changes. No build.

## 2026-06-09 — Educational Visuals for Math Counting

- `src/config/gameConfig.js` — Added `COUNTABLE_GROUPS` (3 semantic categories: fruits 🍎🍌🍓🍊🍒, animals 🐟🐱🐶🐰🐸, everyday 🧸⭐🎈🌸🚗) and `COUNTABLES` (flat export). Updated `PATTERN_SETS.AB`: removed game meta-item `🥚` (egg), added educationally coherent pairs — shapes `['🔺','🔵']`, fruits `['🍎','🍌']`, animals `['🐱','🐶']`. Updated `TEACH_CONTENT.math[0]` examples (🥚🥚🥚 → 🍎🍎🍎, ⭐×5 → 🐟×5). Updated `TEACH_CONTENT.math[8]` pattern examples to match new pattern sets.
- `src/games/GameMath.jsx` — Removed local `COUNTABLES`. Imports `COUNTABLES, COUNTABLE_GROUPS` from gameConfig. `genQ` for `objects` visual model now picks both `emojiA` and `emojiB` from the same semantic group (e.g. 🍎+🍌, 🐱+🐶), so addition visuals are coherent instead of random cross-category pairs.
- `src/games/GameMathBattle.jsx` — Removed local `COUNTABLES`. Imports from gameConfig.
- `src/games/GameSubjectAdventure.jsx` — Removed local `COUNTABLES`. Imports from gameConfig.
- Build: ✅ zero errors. Commit: b050fd1.

## 2026-06-09 — True Full-Screen Mobile Battle Layout (bug fix)

- `src/games/GameScreen.jsx` — Adventure worlds now use `position:fixed;inset:0;zIndex:50` overlay, fully escaping all parent flex constraints. Absolute-positioned `←` back button (z-index 200). Inner `flex:1` div contains the game tree.
- `src/styles.css` — Removed `align-items:center` from `#root` rule. `#root` now only stretches children (no centering). Home still centers itself internally — safe change.
- `src/games/GameSubjectAdventure.jsx` — Default export wrapped in `flex:1/minHeight:0` div so Session fills the overlay. `ResultScreen` root changed `minHeight:'100%'` → `flex:1` for reliable viewport fill in flex context.
- `src/games/MoveSelectBattleMode.jsx` — Root div changed from `height:100%/minHeight:100%` → `flex:1/minHeight:0`.
- `src/games/ChaseMode.jsx` — Root div changed from `height:100%/minHeight:100%` → `flex:1/minHeight:0`.
- `src/games/DefenseMode.jsx` — Root div changed from `height:100%/minHeight:100%` → `flex:1/minHeight:0`.
- Build: ✅ zero errors. Commit: 2ba7922.

## 2026-06-09 — Mobile Playtest Polish: Full-Width UI + Simplified Answer Cards

- `src/games/GameScreen.jsx` — Adventure worlds (`adventure-*`) now use a dedicated full-width container: no `maxWidth`, no `alignItems:'center'` (defaults to stretch), `overflow:'hidden'`. All other worlds keep the existing `maxWidth:480 / alignItems:center` container. Root cause of white-margin bug: `alignItems:'center'` on the flex column container prevented game components from stretching to full width.
- `src/games/MoveSelectBattleMode.jsx` — Removed attack identity layer entirely. Deleted: `ICONS` array, `MOVE_NAME` map, `moveIcons` useMemo, `shuffle` import, `useMemo` import. `MoveCard` now shows **only the learning answer** — no element icon above, no attack name below. Font size adapts to content: ≤2 chars→64px (emoji, digit), ≤4 chars→54px, longer→44px. Battle log for simple hit changed from `"⚡ Thunder! +N XP"` to `"⚔️ โจมตี! +N XP"`. Chunk size: 36.72→36.22 KB.
- Build: ✅ zero errors. Commit: a8759ea.

## 2026-06-09 — Adventure Mode UI 2.0

- `src/games/DefenseMode.jsx` — Full layout redesign. Enemy (attacker) enlarged from 90px → 120px emoji. Removed `QuestionDisplay` component (44px emoji + word + subtext — was dominating the screen). Replaced with compact `QuestionHint` (28px emoji + 🔊 button only, or tiny math/count display). Hit flash overlay added (crit-flash keyframe). Miss animation on wrong choice button (`miss-fizzle`). Red button highlight on wrong tap. Combo indicator top-left (no large badge). Mode text labels removed. Vertical stack unchanged: Enemy → Shield → Egg. Egg gets continuous `egg-idle 3s` idle animation. Move panel: `flex:1` takes bottom half, `flexShrink:0` on all headers.
- `src/games/ChaseMode.jsx` — Full layout redesign. Target emoji enlarged from 64px → 120px, moved to top center (was top-right corner). Removed `QuestionDisplay`. Replaced with same compact `QuestionHint`. Chase track slimmed from 70px → 32px. Egg on track stays (28px canvas). Hit flash overlay added. Miss animation on wrong button. Combo indicator top-left. Target now shows "จับได้แล้ว!" + victory-bounce when dist≥100. Slim track shows gold fill when dist≥80 ("⚡ ใกล้แล้ว!" label inside).
- `src/games/MoveSelectBattleMode.jsx` — Egg idle animation: default state now `egg-idle 3s ease-in-out infinite` instead of `none`. Question hint min-height reduced 46→36px. Minor layout tightening.
- `src/styles.css` — New keyframe `egg-idle` (gentle float + rotate, 3s ease-in-out). Added to `prefers-reduced-motion` suppression.
- Build: ✅ zero errors. GameSubjectAdventure chunk: 36.72KB.

## 2026-06-04 — Pokémon-Style Learning Battle (all 3 subjects)

- `src/games/MoveSelectBattleMode.jsx` — NEW. Pokémon-style battle shell replacing BattleMode in Subject Adventure Engine. One component serves Math/Thai/English via subject adapters. Move panel: 2×2 grid, each card shows `[element icon] [answer content]` (number for Math, emoji for Thai/Eng). No player HP. Wrong answer = miss fizzle + "โจมตีพลาด!". Combo system: streak 2=glow, 3=combo flash, 4+=CRITICAL ×1.5 damage. Ultimate: after 3 consecutive correct, ultimate charges (×2 damage on next correct). Boss encounters at 12% rate. Victory after last question: enemy defeat animation → confetti → fanfare → result screen. Teach intro overlay shown on first-ever play of a level. Anticipation sequence: tap → card pulse → egg charge → egg lunge → hit/miss effects. TTS fires on Thai/English question load. Egg companion: all existing EggCanvas animations, near-hatch glow, combo glow ring.
- `src/games/GameSubjectAdventure.jsx` — Added `genThaiMoveQ()` and `genEngMoveQ()` generators that return emoji choices (not letter choices) for the battle move panel. `genMoveQuestion()` dispatcher selects format by subject. Session now generates battle questions with `genMoveQuestion` when mode is 'battle', classic questions for chase/defense. Replaced `BattleMode` import with `MoveSelectBattleMode`. Passes `isFirstLevel` prop. `ResultScreen` updated: hides score/accuracy from child (score still in sessionLog for parent Report), shows 🎉 ชนะแล้ว! + +XP + ไข่โตขึ้น! only.
- `src/lib/audio.js` — 3 new `playTone()` types: `miss` (soft descending fizzle, no harsh sound), `combo` (rising 3-note chime), `ultimate` (7-note ascending power fanfare).
- `src/styles.css` — 5 new keyframes: `move-pulse` (card tap scale+glow), `egg-charge` (vibrate in place), `miss-fizzle` (card fades/blurs), `enemy-defeat` (enemy shrinks and fades), `crit-flash` (screen flash). Added to `prefers-reduced-motion` suppression.
- Build: ✅ zero errors. GameSubjectAdventure chunk: 36.39KB (was 32.40KB).

## 2026-06-04 — Battle Feel Polish Pass (docs only)

- `docs/research/gameplay/pokemon-style-learning-battle.md` — Updated to align fully with `battle-feel-philosophy.md`. Removed: player HP bar, defeat screen, gentle defeat section, losing states, "every 3 wrong = counter attack" mechanic. Wrong answer philosophy changed: wrong → attack misses → soft fizzle → enemy laughs/taunts → continue (no punishment accumulation, no strike count, no anxiety). Move names reduced: icons + answers are primary; move names are tiny flavor text below icon (or hidden entirely). Move card examples updated to show icon + answer only. Battle log aligned to short format: "⚡ Thunder!", "โจมตีพลาด!", "คอมโบ!", "CRITICAL!", "ชนะแล้ว!". Open question 3 (player HP) resolved: removed. Audio: `gentle-defeat` tone removed; `enemy-taunt` added. Session structure: defeat condition removed, replaced with "child cannot lose" statement. Visual anatomy: player HP bar removed from diagram. Authority note added: Battle Feel Philosophy governs all conflicts.

- No code changes. No build.

## 2026-06-04 — Subject Adventure Engine MVP

- `src/games/GameSubjectAdventure.jsx` — NEW. Orchestrator: generates 8 questions per session from existing content (genMathQ respects player level; genThaiQ from TH_ALPHA emoji→letter; genEngQ from EN_ALPHA emoji→letter). Picks mode deterministically: `MODES[(dayN + playCount) % 3]` so it rotates battle→chase→defense daily per subject. Dispatches ADD_XP, ROUND_COMPLETE, UPDATE_LEVEL_MASTERY, UNLOCK_LEVEL (≥80% score), LOG_SESSION. TTS via useEffect on cur change (speakTh for Thai, speakEn for English). Key-based replay (session key increments → full remount = fresh state + new mode).

Correct: adv-jump animation + enemy red flash + floating damage number. Crit at streak≥2: ×1.5 damage + confetti + streak-bounce badge. Wrong ×3: enemy counter-attack + player shake + HP damage. combo badge shown when streak≥3.
- `src/games/ChaseMode.jsx` — NEW. Horizontal distance track. Start at 30%, +14% per correct (×1.5 on crit), -10% per 3rd wrong. adv-dash animation on correct. Target emoji at right end, player 🦸 trails behind. Distance label updates. "dash" SFX on correct.
- `src/games/DefenseMode.jsx` — NEW. Baby creature (🥚/🐣/🌟 by subject) + shield with pip HP (one pip per question). Attacker → shield ← baby layout. Correct: adv-shield bounce + attacker pushed back + "block" SFX. Wrong ×3: shield pip lost + shake. Shield glows on block via filter.
- `src/games/GameScreen.jsx` — Lazy import + 3 routes for adventure-thai/adventure-math/adventure-eng, each passing subject prop.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — "learn" recommendation routes to `adventure-{world}`. Label/icon updated per subject mode (Math→⚔️, Thai→🛡️, Eng→🏃). Classic games still accessible via "อยากเลือกเอง?" grid.
- `src/lib/audio.js` — `dash` tone (ascending 3-note sawtooth sweep, chase correct); `block` tone (low square thump, defense correct).
- `src/styles.css` — `adv-jump` (player leaps), `adv-dash` (player dashes forward), `adv-shield` (shield bounces on block).
- Build: ✅ zero errors. GameSubjectAdventure lazy chunk: 30KB.

## 2026-06-04 — Battle special move timing + accessibility

- `src/components/BattleScreen.jsx` — Special move prompt moved from pre-battle question phase to mid-battle surprise. Battle now starts immediately (`phase` initialised to `'fighting'`). Special prompt appears as a semi-transparent overlay after attack 2 or 3 (random), while the battle screen remains visible behind it. New question format: Math shows emoji counting (`🍎🍎` → tap 2), Thai/English uses TTS (`speakTh`/`speakEn`) with emoji choices (e.g. "ปลา" → 🐟/🐱/🐶). 🔊 replay button on Thai/English prompt. Correct → exciting special SFX fires immediately + `victory-bounce` "🔥 ท่าพิเศษพร้อมแล้ว!" feedback → special attack animates in battle; Wrong/Skip → gentle "💪 สู้ต่อไปนะ!" or no feedback, battle continues normally — no penalty. HP tracking changed from absolute (log snapshot) to relative (damage-delta) so special damage mid-battle is accurate without a second simulation. `TH_ALPHA`/`EN_ALPHA` imports removed; replaced with compact inline question sets (7 math, 6 Thai, 6 English). Build ✅.

## 2026-06-04 — Math Battle learning mode

- `src/games/GameMathBattle.jsx` — NEW. Battle-wrapped Math MVP. Dark purple (#1a1040) UI. 8 questions per battle against one of 4 cute enemies (🤖👻😈🐲, 64 HP each). Enemy selected randomly. Player's current math level auto-used (no level selector in battle mode). Correct answer → enemy attack flash + HP reduction + battle text. Streak ≥3 → Critical Hit (×1.5 dmg, streak SFX, confetti). Wrong → gentle enemy shake, up to 3 attempts, then reveal. No player HP — child-friendly, zero frustration punishment. All dispatches identical to GameMath: ADD_XP (same formula), ROUND_COMPLETE, UPDATE_LEVEL_MASTERY, UNLOCK_LEVEL, LOG_SESSION (world:'math'). Result screen shows HP drained + replay/home.
- `src/games/GameScreen.jsx` — Lazy-import for GameMathBattle; `mathbattle` added to WORLD_TITLES.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — Continue Adventure Math recommendation: icon `⚔️`, label "Math Battle", sub "ตอบถูก = โจมตี! ⚡". Routes to `mathbattle` world. Subject grid Math card unchanged → still routes to normal `math`.
- Build: ✅ zero errors. Commit: f6e5b74.

## 2026-06-04 — Fix: rewards from Continue Adventure

- `src/context/StateContext.jsx` — Fixed race condition where `loadState()` async callback and the `SIGNED_IN` auth handler could dispatch `INIT` with stale Supabase data, silently reverting XP, items, and egg progress earned since app start. Fix: before dispatching `INIT`, compare `remote.rounds` against `stateRef.current.rounds` (the always-current ref already wired in the context). If local is ahead (user made progress before the async resolve or token refresh fired), keep local state and push it to Supabase instead. Guest mode and new-device/fresh-install paths unaffected.

## 2026-06-04 — Animation juice polish

- `src/styles.css` — 10 new `@keyframes` + utility classes: `pulse-float` (Continue Adventure gentle bob), `battle-glow-pulse` (purple glow ring for battle card), `shimmer-bright` (Surprise card), `slide-down-in` (subject grid open), `victory-bounce` (win/done emoji), `item-pop-in` (reward box), `streak-bounce` (Shop streak feedback), `hatch-glow` (creature reveal golden drop-shadow), `modal-pop` (creature detail card), `answer-correct-glow` (correct choice ring). `.catalog-item:hover` lift + shadow; `.choice-btn.correct` enhanced with dual animation. `@media(prefers-reduced-motion:reduce)` block disables all decorative animations.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — adventure card gets `rec-card-float` (default) or `rec-card-battle` (challenger); Surprise card gets `rec-card-surprise`; subject grid gets `subjects-slide-in` on open.
- `src/components/BattleScreen.jsx` — win emoji: `victory-bounce`; reward box: `item-pop-in`; special-move correct feedback emoji: `victory-bounce`.
- `src/components/HatchOverlay.jsx` — creature emoji at done phase: `hatch-reveal-glow`.
- `src/games/GameShop.jsx` — done screen emoji: `victory-bounce`; streak feedback: `streak-win` (streak-bounce); `streak: true` flag added to streak feedback state.
- Build: ✅ zero errors. Commit: b5ff1a5.

## 2026-06-04 — Audio polish and louder phonics

- `src/lib/audio.js` — 9 new tones added to `playTone()`: `tap` (warm pop), `open` (2-note upward chirp), `unlock` (4-note ascending jingle), `item` (sparkle arpeggio), `eggReady` (3-note glowing pulse), `reveal` (5-note sweep + sine), `start` (energetic burst), `complete` (4-note mission jingle), `cardOpen` (2-note soft pop). Phonics GainNode boosted from 2.5 → 4.0.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — `playTone('tap')` on Continue Adventure + Surprise Event tap. `playTone('open'/'click')` on subject grid toggle. `playTone('eggReady')` fires once when `state.readyToHatch` transitions true.
- `src/components/Collection.jsx` — `playTone('cardOpen')` on creature card tap; `playTone('click')` on popup close.
- `src/components/HatchOverlay.jsx` — `playTone('reveal')` + staggered `fanfare` (350ms) at creature reveal (`done` phase).
- `src/components/BattleScreen.jsx` — `playTone('item')` fires 950ms after win (reward popup timing). Added `playTone` import.
- `src/games/GameShop.jsx` — `playTone('complete')` at ≥80% pass (was silent); ≥90% keeps `fanfare`.
- `src/games/GamePhonics.jsx` / `GameMath.jsx` / `GameThai.jsx` — `playTone('unlock')` on level unlock; `playTone('complete')` on pass (80–89%).
- Build: ✅ zero errors. Commit: 78a6ddd.

## 2026-06-04 — Battle learning special move

- `src/components/BattleScreen.jsx` — New question phase before each battle. `pickBattleQuestion(sessionLog)` selects subject from most-played recent sessions (safest readiness signal); falls back to simple Math (1+1→4+4) when no data. Question UI: full-screen dark overlay, 4 large tap-target buttons, skip link. Correct answer → `specialDmgRef` = 25% of enemy HP; 900ms "🔥 ท่าพิเศษพร้อมแล้ว!" feedback; `setPhase('fighting')`. Wrong/skip → 700ms "💪 สู้ต่อไปนะ!" feedback; battle starts normally. Special attack plays at battle start: ⚡ text + new 5-note ascending 'special' SFX + hit flash + gold damage float. Enemy HP re-simulated from reduced starting value so win condition is correct. Also fixed ATK/DEF advice text mismatch (was: Thai→ATK, Math→DEF; now: Math→ATK, Thai→DEF to match calcCreatureStats formula).
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Battle balance and sound

- `src/config/gameConfig.js` — All AI_OPPONENTS HP scaled ×4 (regular/miniboss) and ×3.5 (boss); all ATK scaled ×2.5. Battles now last 6–15 turns instead of 2–4.
- `src/components/BattleScreen.jsx` — Imported `getSoundOn`/`getACtx` from audio.js. `playBattleSound` now respects sound toggle and reuses shared AudioContext. Added `attack` sound type (sword-swing whoosh). Improved `hit` (3-layer impact), `crit` (4-tone ascending), `win` (6-note fanfare), `lose` (gentler 4-tone descent). `attack` sound fires when attack text is shown; `hit` fires on flash.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Battle Home experience

- `src/components/BottomNav.jsx` — ⚔️ badge removed from Collection tab. `hasChallenger` and `useAppState` import removed.
- `src/App.jsx` — `challengerOpen` state added; useEffect watches `state.pendingChallenger`; `<ChallengerOverlay open={challengerOpen} onClose=.../>` and `<Home onOpenChallenger=.../>` wired.
- `src/components/ChallengerOverlay.jsx` — internal `visible` useState and its useEffect removed; now accepts `open`/`onClose` props. All `setVisible(false)` replaced with `onClose()`.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — `onOpenChallenger` prop added. Battle case in `getRecommendation()` (priority: hatch → battle → shop → subject). Battle card: dark gradient, challenger emoji, "มอนสเตอร์ปรากฏตัว!". `handleRecommendedAction` calls `onOpenChallenger()` for battle type.
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` — Home 2.0 Adventure Director entry updated.
- `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/GPT_HANDOFF.md` — updated.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

- `src/games/GameShop.jsx` — speech added after correct answers. Import: `speakTh, speakEn` from audio.js. `THAI_NUMS` array added (หนึ่ง–สิบ). After correct: Thai questions → `speakTh(val)` after 380ms; English → `speakEn(val)` after 380ms; Math/counting → `speakTh(THAI_NUMS[val])` after 380ms. Social phrase question speaks the child's actual choice (ขอบคุณครับ or ขอบคุณค่ะ). All tones preserved. Sound toggle respected.
- `docs/research/progression/gameplay-loop.md` — "Learning Feedback Principles" section added: visual/sound/speech pattern, implementation status per game, what to avoid.
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — Learning Feedback Principles section added.
- `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/GPT_HANDOFF.md` — updated.

## 2026-06-04 — Home UI simplification

- `src/components/Home.jsx` — subject section made collapsible: "หรือเลือกเรียน" static label replaced with "อยากเลือกเอง?" toggle button (`subjectsOpen` useState, default false); subject cards hidden until toggled. Shop Mission permanent card removed from Home (Shop still reachable via Continue Adventure recommendation when shopV1.runs === 0). Visual hierarchy: Egg → Continue Adventure → "อยากเลือกเอง?" → Egg Run → Surprise.
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` — Home 2.0 and Shop Mission entries updated to reflect new state.
- `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/GPT_HANDOFF.md` — updated.

## 2026-06-04 — Egg pacing + creature stat rebalance

### Part 1 — Egg progression pacing
- `src/context/StateContext.jsx` — `scaledEggProgress(state)` helper added (module-level). Computes `required = min(800, 120 + hatchedEggs.length * 60)`, divides into 7 stages dynamically, returns `{stage, stageXP, pct, xpPerStage, required}`. `ADD_XP` reducer: replaced static `newStage`-based `readyToHatch` with `newTotal >= hatchRequired` (dynamic). `derived` useMemo: `eggProgressData` now uses `scaledEggProgress()`; `eggStatsData.stage` overridden to scaled stage so `drawEgg()` visual matches progress display. `state.hatchedEggs` added to useMemo deps.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — destructures `xpPerStage` from `eggProgressData`; egg XP label updated: shows "เกือบฟักแล้ว!" in stage 6 before ready, uses dynamic `xpPerStage` denominator instead of hardcoded 50.

### Part 2 — Creature battle stat rebalance
- `src/config/gameConfig.js` — `calcCreatureStats()` rewritten with weighted formula. Old: ATK=base×thaiShare (exclusive ownership — ATK=0 if no Thai XP). New: every stat has 40% base guarantee + 60% subject-weighted. HP: 1.5+0.3t+0.1m+0.1e; ATK: 0.4+0.3m+0.2e+0.1t; DEF: 0.4+0.3t+0.2m+0.1e; SPD: 0.4+0.3e+0.2m+0.1t. Deterministic ±5% personality variation from XP seed. Minimum possible any stat = base × 0.5 (Thai-only learner) — no more 0 stats.
- `src/lib/state.js` — `_migrateEggs()` updated: recalculates stats if any of ATK/DEF/SPD is 0 or NaN (covers pre-rebalance eggs with broken stats).
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Shop feedback + hatch overlay fix

- `src/games/GameShop.jsx` — feedback improvements:
  - `wrongChoice` state added; `.wrong` CSS class (shake animation) applied to the wrong button on incorrect answer. Cleared on correct / next / replay.
  - `STREAK_MSGS` array added; when streak ≥ 3 feedback message uses fire messages instead of generic correct msg.
  - Streak counter in header styled amber bold at ≥ 3 (was muted/small).
  - Wrong feedback text changed from "ไม่ถูก ลองอีกครั้ง! 🤔" to "ลองอีกครั้ง! 💪"; reveal message now friendlier: `คำตอบที่ถูกคือ "${q.answer}" 😊`.
  - All existing `playTone` calls unchanged.
- `src/components/HatchOverlay.jsx` — two bug fixes:
  - **Freeze fix**: `setPhase('tapping')` called as first line of `handleClose()`. After dispatch+navigate, `isOpen` is `false` and `phase` is `'tapping'` → condition `!isOpen && phase === 'tapping'` is true → overlay unmounts cleanly. No more frozen screen requiring refresh.
  - **Mid-game interruption fix**: `suppressAutoOpen` prop (default false). When `true`, `isOpen` ignores `readyToHatch && !hatched` auto-trigger. Only explicit `state.hatching` (user-initiated) can open overlay.
- `src/App.jsx` — passes `suppressAutoOpen={screen === 'game'}` to `HatchOverlay`. During gameplay, hatch overlay won't auto-interrupt. After returning to home, `readyToHatch` is still true → overlay appears normally.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Home 2.0: Adventure Director + NaN bug fixes

- `src/components/Home.jsx` — rewritten as Adventure Director.
  - **`⭐ ผจญภัยต่อ`** section: single large recommended card above the world grid. Deterministic priority: (1) hatch if egg ready, (2) Shop if never played, (3) weakest subject by XP. No AI, no state.
  - **`🎁 เซอร์ไพรส์วันนี้`** section: replaces the 2×2 minigame grid. One unlocked minigame shown per day (date-hash mod count of unlocked games). After playing, shows "เล่นแล้ว! มาพรุ่งนี้นะ 🌙" (derived from `sessionLog`, no new state). If no minigames unlocked yet, shows a teaser card.
  - World-label text changed to "หรือเลือกเรียน" (secondary framing).
  - `getRecommendation()` and `getSurpriseEvent()` helper functions added (module-level, no hooks).
- `src/components/Report.jsx` — **NaN bug fixes** in `MissionAnalytics`:
  - `totalHints = 0`, `totalDuration = 0` default values added to destructuring (handles pre-Phase-D state with no analytics fields).
  - `avgScore` now returns `null` when `totalQs === 0` (renders as `—` not `0%`).
  - `avgDur` now returns `null` when `totalDuration === 0` (renders as `—` not `NaN`).
  - `nudge` guard updated: `avgScore !== null && avgScore >= 90`.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Subject Readiness Report display

- `src/components/Report.jsx` — `computeReadiness(sessionLog, world)` added: filters last 10 `sessionLog` entries per world, derives one of 4 states (strong / comfortable / exploring / notready) from avgScore + goodRuns + completionRate thresholds. `SubjectReadiness` component renders a card with color-coded Thai-language badges for ภาษาไทย / คณิต / อังกฤษ. Observation footnote: "ดูจากการเล่นล่าสุด ไม่ใช่เลเวลที่ปลดล็อก". No new state fields.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-03 — Subject Readiness Design (docs only)

- `docs/research/observation/play-observation-system.md` — **Subject Readiness** section added: 4 readiness states (Strong / Comfortable / Exploring / Not Ready), derivation logic (last 10 sessions, avgScore ≥ 0.85 + goodRuns ≥ 3 + completionRate ≥ 0.80 for Strong; avgScore ≥ 0.70 + goodRuns ≥ 2 for Comfortable; else Exploring; no sessions = Not Ready), explicit non-goals (no AI, no gate, no child UI, no level tree), phase status section updated to mark Phase D shipped and describe Phase D+ scope.
- `docs/research/observation/play-observation-system.md` — Peer Comparison section updated: marked as ✅ done (replaced in Phase D).
- `docs/research/missions/mission-system.md` — **Subject Readiness and Mission Design** section added: explains why highest unlocked level is unreliable, defines mission content weighting from readiness profile, example profiles (Thai Strong / Math Comfortable / English Exploring → Thai 60% / Math 30% / English 10%), when to apply per mission phase, core principle "Mission should follow the child."
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — Subject Readiness Decisions section added: 9 decisions covering derivation, mission weighting, Shop Stretch independence, Cooking Mission dependency, implementation timing.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — Phase D+ Subject Readiness documentation marked done; Cooking Mission task updated with readiness dependency warning; Subject Readiness Report display added as deferred task.
- No app code changed.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase D: Play Observation System

- `src/lib/state.js` — `sessionLog: []` added to `defaultState()`; `shopV1` extended with `totalHints: 0`, `totalDuration: 0`, `phaseStats: { 1–4 }`.

- `src/games/GamePhonics.jsx` — `useRef` import added; `sessionStart` refs added to all 4 game components (PhonicsGame, CVCGame, SightGame, SentenceGame); `LOG_SESSION` dispatched in each `next()` when done; replay resets refs.
- `src/components/Report.jsx` — `MissionAnalytics` component added (runs, avg score, avg duration, hints, phase difficulty table, replay framing, deterministic nudge); peer-comparison card replaced with play-history timeline (last 10 sessions).
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-03 — Workflow Audit + Architecture Language Patch (docs only)

- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — fixed two present-tense statements that implied `MissionScreen.jsx` + `missionConfig.js` are current architecture. Both are future targets (after 2+ missions). Current routing clarified: Home → `GameScreen.jsx` → `GameShop.jsx` (world `'shop'`).

- `src/games/GameScreen.jsx` — lazy-imports `GameShop`, adds `shop` world to `WORLD_TITLES`.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — Missions section added above Egg Run. Shop card shows best score and run count after first play. Always unlocked.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase B+ Mastery-Gate Patch: mastery signal tightened, Stretch content confirmed
- `mission-system.md`: Mastery signal simplified to 3 hard criteria — accuracy ≥ 90%, ≤ 1 wrong, ≥ 2 runs. Removed "hint dependency" from hard criteria (not tracked yet; can be added later). Speed re-clarified as optional context only, never a gate.
- `shop-mission.md`: Shop Stretch section updated with explicit unlock trigger listing the 3 criteria. "Why 4 steps" section rewritten — quantity difference and price concept named as Stretch, Core MVP steps stated inline.
- `GPT_NOTES.md`: Product Decisions — mastery signal now 3 explicit criteria; Shop Core/Stretch split named explicitly.
- `TASKS.md`: Mastery signal note updated — speed NOT required.
- No app code changed.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase B Review Patch: Mission MVP scope tightened
- `shop-mission.md`: MVP reduced 6 → 4 steps. Price/money and quantity-difference steps moved to Later Expansion (Early Grade 1 stretch) — not deleted.
- `mission-system.md`: Unlock threshold 70% → 80% (aligned with subject levels; 70% guessable on 4 questions). Engine philosophy updated: start with `GameShop.jsx`, delay generic `MissionScreen.jsx` until pattern validated.
- `GPT_NOTES.md`: Architecture suggestions updated to staged approach; threshold and step count corrected.
- `TASKS.md`: Now task updated — 4-step MVP, GameShop.jsx first, no missionConfig/MissionScreen yet.
- No app code changed.

## 2026-06-03 — Mission System Design Review & Patch
- Confirmed existing mission docs (README, mission-system, shop, cooking, garden) are complete.
- Added "Explicit Non-Goals" section to `mission-system.md`: no payment, no multiplayer, no social features, no Grade 2+, no AI tutor, no unique mini-games.
- No other changes needed — TASKS, GPT_NOTES, RESEARCH_INDEX already up to date.

## 2026-06-03 — Mission System Design (documentation only)
- Created `docs/research/missions/` with 5 files: README, mission-system, shop-mission, cooking-mission, garden-mission.
- Mission system: 3 types (Progression/Review/Challenge), reuses all existing mechanics, data-driven via `missionConfig.js`, thin `MissionScreen.jsx` wrapper.
- Shop mission MVP: 6 steps, Kindergarten core + Grade 1 stretch, integrates Thai/Math/English/GK. Full data structure specified.
- Cooking and garden missions: design only — not for implementation until shop is confirmed working.
- Updated `GPT_NOTES.md`, `TASKS.md`, `RESEARCH_INDEX.md`, `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`.
- No app code changed.

## 2026-06-03 — Vision + Scope Documentation
- Created `PROJECT.md` — one-page project brief (what, who, golden rule, success metric).
- Created `VISION.md` — full design philosophy: golden rule, mastery progression, Year 1 scope, stable engine, content strategy, replay philosophy, non-goals, scope guardian mandate.
- Created `GOALS.md` — Year 1 goals, non-goals, long-term goals, definition of done.
- Created `docs/README.md` — navigation index for all docs by audience role.
- Updated `docs/DECISIONS.md` — added mastery-based progression, Golden Rule, replay philosophy, scope guardian decisions under Product and AI sections.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` — scope guardian check added to Before Coding section.
- Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — stable engine note replaces stale React migration note.
- Updated `SPEC.md` — deprecated header updated to canonical format.
- Updated `docs/GPT_HANDOFF.md` — vision section added; recommended next work updated to Year 1 scope.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase 3: AI_OPPONENTS Tiers 2–5
- `gameConfig.js`: Added tiers 2–5 to `AI_OPPONENTS`. Stats scale ~1.5× per tier. Sonic villain theme continues:
  - T2 ป.3-4: Coconuts/Octus/Rexon → Egg Robo → Dr. Eggman III
  - T3 ป.5-6: Rhino-Bot/Slicer/Jawz → Heavy Gunner → Dr. Eggman IV
  - T4 ม.ต้น: GUN Mech/E-101 Beta/Dark Chao → Egg Emperor → Dr. Eggman V
  - T5 ม.ปลาย: Metal Sonic/Shadow Android/Silver Gladiator → Mephiles → PERFECT CHAOS
- `StateContext.jsx`: Fixed challenger grade→tier mapping (`Math.min(grade,1)` → proper mapping: 0→0, 1-2→1, 3-4→2, 5-6→3).

## 2026-06-03 — Phase 2 UX (Sound Persist + XP Boost Indicator)
- **Sound persistence**: `App.jsx` initializes `soundOn` from `localStorage.getItem('kq_sound')`; all toggle callbacks write `kq_sound` on change. Device-local key, separate from `kq_state` blob.
- **XP boost badge**: new `XpBoostBadge` component in `Home.jsx` — shows amber `⭐ ×2 M:SS` countdown in header when `xpBoostEnd > now` and `xpBoost > 1`; hides automatically when boost expires; 1-second interval via `useRef`.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase 1 UX Readiness
- **Replaced `alert()`** in `Home.jsx` with `showToast()` calls — EggRun lock and no-lives both show friendly toast messages; minigame dead-guard removed.
- **New `ProfileModal.jsx`**: name input + grade grid (อนุบาล–ป.6); saves via `SET_PROFILE` action; persisted to localStorage + Supabase automatically.
- **Profile button** (👤 + child name) added to Home header — always visible, opens ProfileModal.
- **`SET_PROFILE` action** added to `StateContext.jsx` + reducer case.
- `App.jsx`: ProfileModal mounted alongside LoginModal; `onOpenProfile` prop wired to Home.

## 2026-06-03 — Docs Sync (Current State Audit)
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` updated: Math level count corrected (6 → 9), visual models added, tier system detailed, minigame unlock conditions expanded, Vercel/phonics audio noted accurately.
- `TASKS.md` restructured: consolidated Done list, added visual models + tiers + AI_OPPONENTS entries, removed duplicate items, added Math L9+ and English L5+ to Later.
- `GPT_HANDOFF.md` regenerated to reflect latest codebase state.
- No app code changed.

## 2026-06-03 — Math Visual Models for L1–L4
- `gameConfig.js`: added `visualModel` field to math levels 1–4 (`objects`, `objects`, `tenFrame`, `crossOut`).
- `GameMath.jsx`: `genQ` numeric branch now attaches `visualModel`, `emojiA`, `emojiB` to question object.
- New `VisualModel` component with 4 modes:
  - `objects`: real emoji grid (emojiA×a + emojiB×b) with `+` separator; smaller font when total > 10.
  - `tenFrame`: 2×5 or 4×5 coloured grid (amber=a, blue=b, grey=empty); fallback dots if total > 20.
  - `crossOut`: emoji grid with ❌ overlay on the last `b` items (subtraction visualisation).
  - `null` (L5+): unchanged coloured 🟡/🔵 dots.

## 2026-06-03 — Math Content Expansion + New Question Types
- `MATH_WORDS` expanded from 16 → 30: added joining, taking-away, and 10 comparison problems (`comparison:true`).
- `PATTERN_SETS` added to `gameConfig.js` (5 AB emoji pairs; ABC reserved for L9).
- `LEVELS.math` expanded: Level 0 (Foundation/count), Level 7 (เปรียบเทียบ), Level 8 (รูปแบบ AB).
- `TEACH_CONTENT.math` entries added for keys 0, 7, 8.
- `GameMath.jsx`: new `count` and `pattern` question types; foundation mode (grade-0 only, no timer); maxLevels `6→8`; amber hint highlight for patterns at attempt 1.
- `LevelSelector.jsx`: optional `levelsOverride` prop added.
- `StateContext.jsx`: `FOUNDATION_COMPLETE` action added.
- `state.js`: `foundationComplete: false` added to `defaultState()`.

## 2026-06-03 — SPEC.md Formally Deprecated (Session 6)

## 2026-06-03 — Docs Verified + Trimmed (Session 2)
- Verified all docs against real codebase; no feature inaccuracies found.
- Fixed stale `gameConfig.js` line count (354 → 346) in PROJECT_MAP and CODEBASE_SUMMARY.
- Trimmed all docs to meet token limits (CURRENT_STATE ≤120, PROJECT_MAP ≤120, CODEBASE_SUMMARY ≤150, SESSION_SUMMARY ≤30).
