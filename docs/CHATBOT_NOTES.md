# CHATBOT_NOTES.md — Phase 1: Friend Code System

## Claude Code Handoff
_(Claude Code appends here after each session)_

**2026-07-01 — Companion egg enlarged + centered on Home:**
- Built: Follow-up fix to the same-day Home redesign — the redesign left the companion visible only as the tiny 48px room-walker sprite, which didn't read as "the main character." Gave `DecoratedRoom.jsx` a `showWalker` prop (default `true`, so `Room.jsx`'s call site — which doesn't pass it — is completely unaffected and still shows its small walker + placement grid exactly as before). Home now passes `showWalker={false}` so `DecoratedRoom` draws only the room background/furniture each frame (walker's RAF update/draw skipped via a ref-read flag). On top, added a large centered 200×236 `EggCanvas` reusing the pre-redesign large-egg pipeline (re-added `cssAnimToEggAnim`/`cssAnimToMood` helpers for anim/mood/glow), tappable via the existing egg-zone `onClick`, with a scale-bounce on `creatureBounce`. Equipped cosmetics show automatically (the `EggCanvas` wrapper defaults to `state.equipped`). Repositioned the floating reaction/heal-float (now above the egg's head, `calc(50% - 138px)`) and tap particles (now centered on the egg, `50%`) — both were tuned for the old tiny-walker position.
- Not finished: Nothing — this was a small, complete visual fix.
- Blockers/risks found: None.
- Live verification (Chrome, running dev server, account "โชแปง"): large glowing egg renders centered over the room art; tap-to-pet confirmed working (expression changed to happy, aura shifted to warm gold glow); Room screen re-checked and still shows its walker + grid unaffected. Build clean (168 modules).
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System, content expansion, or the minigame-picker-screen decision flagged in the prior Home redesign session.
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Nothing blocking.

**2026-07-01 — Home screen redesign:**
- Built: Rewrote `src/components/Home.jsx` to the approved layout — (1) simplified header: small circular companion-egg avatar + child name + egg-stage name (whole block taps to Profile/Login), 🔥 login-streak pill, 🪙 coin pill, 🔊/🔇 sound toggle; removed the pulsing "พร้อมฟัก!" badge and the old text login/profile button. (2) New thin status bar with three chips ❤️ HP / ⭐ XP / 💕 Bond (proportional bars, no numbers) — **Bond meter shown on Home for the first time**. (3) `<DecoratedRoom>` promoted from the full-viewport `zIndex:-1` background into the flex-1 hero zone so the walking companion egg is actually visible in the middle; floating "Lv.N · [stage name]" pill top-center; DecoratedRoom internals untouched. (4) Egg-tap-to-pet preserved via a transparent tap target (armed item → use; post-hatch → +bond & floating emoji; pre-hatch → pet/hatch). (5) Party bar removed. (6) Compact evolution-progress bar removed from Home. (7) Pre/post-hatch JSX branch split collapsed into one layout. (8) Minigame shortcut card added. (9) Item tray restyled (bigger icons + status line) with all logic unchanged. (10) Full-width "🗺️ ออกสำรวจ!" button; old "ลูบ!" button removed. No state shape / reducer / other-screen changes; `eggAlgorithm.js` untouched. Docs updated (CURRENT_STATE, TASKS, CHANGELOG).
- New-player zero-egg case: preserved the hatch flow. When `readyToHatch && hatchedEggs.length===0`, a pulsing "แตะเพื่อฟักไข่!" CTA renders in the egg zone and tapping the egg fires `SET_HATCHING` (via `handlePetEgg`). The single simplified layout reads `activeEgg` with `?.`/fallbacks (HP 100%, Bond 0%) so a genuinely new account renders and can still hatch — onboarding for future accounts is intact. Verified by code (the live test account already has hatched eggs; I did not zero out its `hatchedEggs` because that risks the documented resolveSync-revert bug + leaving test data).
- Minigame shortcut destination: launches **Egg Memory** directly (`SET_CURRENT_WORLD:'memory'` + `navigate('game')`). Found that **no minigame-picker screen exists** and, more surprisingly, GameScreen + all 5 minigames were **completely unreachable** before this change — `SET_CURRENT_WORLD` was dispatched nowhere and `navigate('game')` appeared nowhere; Phase 6 map-tile launches are unbuilt. Building a real picker is out of scope for "redesign Home.jsx", so I did the minimal 2-line wiring to the first-listed, dependency-free game.
- Live browser verification (Chrome vs running dev server, logged-in account "โชแปง"): layout matches spec; egg-tap pet works; arm-food → tap-egg → use decremented 172→171; minigame card → Egg Memory grid; explore → Green Meadow map; bottom nav + Shop + Room screens visually unaffected; zero console errors. Build clean (168 modules).
- Not finished: Zero-egg render not exercised live (reasoned via code, see above). Egg-tap pet + minigame launch have no unlock gating (GameScreen renders whatever `currentWorld` is set to) — fine for now.
- Blockers/risks found: None blocking. Scope-guardian flag raised on the minigame picker (see below).
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System; or Thai/Math/English content expansion.
- Needs Chatbot decision first: **Minigame picker screen** — should there be a dedicated "choose a minigame" screen (with unlock gating per CURRENT_STATE), or should minigames be reached via map tiles (Phase 6)? The Home shortcut currently hardcodes Egg Memory as a placeholder destination.

**2026-07-01 — Sweep: lastSavedAt on every mutating reducer:**
- Built: Follow-up to the previous two resolveSync-revert fixes (`c74e83d` for coins, `036070f` for cosmetics/room items). The prior session flagged that `ADD_COINS` and other reducers likely shared the same latent gap. Did a full audit of `StateContext.jsx`'s ~70 `case ACTIONS.*` reducers and added `lastSavedAt: Date.now()` to every case that returns a genuinely mutated state — XP/round/hatch, home/battle items, mastery/level/subject progress, egg-run scores, happiness, battle records, profile, shopV1/session/response-time logs, world/screen navigation, party/battle-creature flow, creature HP/bond/evolution/stats, boss/maze state, pending level-up/rewards, and `ADD_COINS`. Excluded only `INIT` (must preserve the loaded snapshot's own `lastSavedAt`, not stamp a fresh one), the true no-op `ENCOUNTER_TRIGGERED`, the `USE_ITEM`/`DROP_ITEM` aliases (they delegate via recursive `reducer()` calls into already-stamped cases), and the six reducers `036070f` already fixed.
- Verification: wrote a `+5` coin bump to `localStorage.kq_state` with a fresh `lastSavedAt` (mirroring the patched `ADD_COINS` reducer's exact output shape) against the real running app/account, reloaded, confirmed it survived (11→16 in the HUD), then restored the account to 11 coins so no test data was left behind. Build clean (168 modules). Wrote a small Node script to scan every `case` block and confirm none were missed (only INIT/ENCOUNTER_TRIGGERED/aliases lack the stamp, as intended).
- Not finished: Did not touch `resolveSync()` itself or attempt a field-level merge — kept the fix minimal and consistent with the established per-reducer stamp pattern, per the previous session's own judgment that a resolveSync rearchitecture would be over-engineering for this defect class.
- Blockers/risks found: None. This should be the durable, permanent close of this bug class — but note any *future* reducer added to `StateContext.jsx` that forgets to add `lastSavedAt` will silently reintroduce it (there's no lint/test enforcing this). Worth flagging to Chatbot if this recurs a third time — a small unit test asserting every `case` branch's output includes `lastSavedAt` would catch it automatically.
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System, or content expansion (Thai/Math/English).
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Nothing blocking. Optional: should a lint/test guard against future reducers missing `lastSavedAt`? Flagging as a suggestion, not doing it unprompted (would be scope creep beyond this sweep).

**2026-07-01 — fix: bought cosmetics disappear after close/reopen (resolveSync race):**
- Built: Fixed the live-reported bug where a bought cosmetic (e.g. a bow) showed as owned in-session but was gone after a full close/reopen (shop re-prompted to buy). Root cause was the EXACT same class as `c74e83d`: `BUY_ITEM` and `EQUIP_ITEM` (`StateContext.jsx`) updated `ownedItems`/`equipped` but never bumped `lastSavedAt`, so the in-memory state kept the previous session's timestamp. A later `resolveSync` (mount `loadState().then` at `:1009`, or `SIGNED_IN` listener at `:1059`) compared the frozen local timestamp against a stale remote Supabase snapshot, hit the `remoteTime >= localTime` tie rule, picked remote, and dispatched `INIT` — reverting the purchase and then persisting the reverted state everywhere. Fix = the same one-liner as `c74e83d`: added `lastSavedAt: Date.now()` to `BUY_ITEM` + `EQUIP_ITEM`, and to the room reducers (`BUY_ROOM_ITEM`, `PLACE_ROOM_ITEM`, `REMOVE_ROOM_ITEM`) which had the identical latent gap. `migrateStateShape()` was NOT the cause (it preserves both fields via spread). No resolveSync rearchitecture — matched the existing pattern.
- Not finished: The buy-through-UI click was not exercised live (save has 11 coins, cheapest cosmetic is 30 — same precedent as the furniture session). Buy step is code-verified; the persistence/resolveSync half was live-verified.
- Blockers/risks found: `ADD_COINS` and round/battle coin-award reducers likely share the same latent no-`lastSavedAt`-bump gap; not observed reverting in practice (they usually sync before the next resolveSync) and out of this task's scope, but worth a sweep if any "earned X reverted" report appears. The real fix is a per-mutation `lastSavedAt` stamp on EVERY mutating reducer, or making `resolveSync` field-merge — deferred as it's not currently biting.
- Ready to start next: Optional audit/sweep of all mutating reducers to stamp `lastSavedAt` uniformly (prevents this whole bug class); or Phase 4 NPC System.
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Nothing blocking.

**2026-07-01 — World-map cosmetics + dead code cleanup:**
- Built: (1) `WorldScreen.jsx`'s `window.__kq_companionEgg` now includes `equipped: state.equipped ?? null`, closing the deferred item from the previous two sessions. `tileEngine.renderPlayer` (`tileEngine.js:242`) already spreads the whole companion object into `renderEggSprite`, so no change was needed there — the existing `drawCosmetics` step (added for the Home room-walker fix) now also draws on the 16×16 map walker automatically. (2) Deleted `src/components/HomeBackground.jsx` (confirmed zero remaining imports; `Home.jsx` uses `DecoratedRoom`) and cleaned up a stale reference in `Home.jsx`'s header comment.
- Not finished: Live browser re-verification of the map-walker cosmetics was not performed this session — the logged-in Chrome tab from the prior task's live-testing pass had already closed by the time this task started, and re-doing the login flow for a 2-line, pattern-matched change (identical to the already-live-verified `DecoratedRoom.jsx` fix) wasn't judged worth another login round-trip. Verified via clean `npm run build` (168 modules, zero errors) + direct code read confirming the spread propagates `equipped` correctly.
- Blockers/risks found: None. `CURRENT_STATE.md` had several stale references to `HomeBackground.jsx` from before it was deleted (some going back to the original creature→egg migration doc pass); updated the ones describing current live behavior, left older architecture-log prose otherwise alone (out of scope for this pass).
- Ready to start next: A live click-through of the world map to visually eyeball cosmetics on the walker sprite would close the loop (someone should just log in and look). Otherwise: Phase 4 NPC System, or a `CURRENT_STATE.md` "Home Screen" section rewrite (that section still describes the pre-DecoratedRoom sky/mountains scene and legacy `drawCreature` zone — needs a fuller pass beyond this session's scope).
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Nothing blocking.

**2026-07-01 — Furniture tab CSS collapse fix:**
- Built: Fixed the real (live-confirmed) reason the shop furniture tab was unreachable — a CSS flexbox min-size collapse, NOT the data/import issue that the 2026-06-30 changelog entry and a later static audit claimed. The top-level 👗/🏠 tab-switcher div in `Collection.jsx` sets `overflow:hidden` (to clip rounded corners) and lives inside the outer flex-column (`overflowY:auto`, height:100%). Per flexbox's automatic-min-size rule, an `overflow:hidden` flex item gets min-height 0, so with page content taller than the viewport the shrink algorithm collapsed it 42px→2px — both tab buttons became an invisible, unclickable sliver, so a real pointer could never reach the furniture tab (only a scripted JS `.click()` could, which is why every prior static/scripted check "passed"). Fix: added `flexShrink:0, flexGrow:0` to that div. Found + fixed a SECOND identical instance (also live-verified at 2px): the Head/Face (หัว/หน้า) sub-tab bar in the wearable section — same pattern, same one-line fix (2px→38px). Live-verified in Chrome vs the running dev server: reloaded, real-clicked 🏠 เฟอร์นิเจอร์, all 12 furniture items rendered; try-on preview (party hat on egg + tags) and Room (ห้อง) tab both still work — no regressions.
- Not finished: The live buy-flow click was NOT exercised — the save has 11 coins, cheapest furniture is 30. Did not manipulate coins/localStorage. Buy logic instead verified by reading `handleBuyFurniture` + `BUY_ROOM_ITEM` reducer (guards insufficient coins + duplicate ownership, deducts price, appends to `ownedRoomItems`) — correct.
- Blockers/risks found: The general anti-pattern (`overflow:hidden` on a shrinkable flex item inside a flex-column) can recur anywhere. Checked `Collection.jsx` + `Room.jsx`; only the two tab bars were affected (Room.jsx line 150 already had `flexShrink:0`; its item strip uses `overflowX:auto` horizontal scroll — fine). Worth remembering when adding future segmented controls.
- Ready to start next: Thread `equipped` into the world-map player sprite for cosmetics parity; or Phase 4 NPC System.
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Nothing blocking.

**2026-07-01 — Shop live try-on preview:**
- Built: `Collection.jsx` cosmetics tab now has a large companion preview egg at the top (real element/eye/gender/stage/aura via `eggProgressData.stage` + `stageToAura`). New local-only state `preview: {slot,id}|null` drives `previewEquipped = preview ? {...equipped,[slot]:id} : undefined`, passed as the big egg's `equipped` prop (undefined → wrapper falls back to real `state.equipped`). Tapping ANY card is instant: unowned → `preview` only (free, no dispatch, no coins), with a "👀 ลองใส่" tag over the big egg + "👀 กำลังลอง" per-card and a "ซื้อ 🪙price" buy button; owned → real `EQUIP_ITEM` toggle (reducer contract unchanged) + clears preview. Preview resets on unmount / buy / real equip / top-tab switch, so leaving the shop never persists an unbought try-on. Also resolved the deferred walker-cosmetics item: `renderEggSprite.js` gained an `equipped` param + `drawCosmetics` step, and `DecoratedRoom.jsx` threads `state.equipped` into its companion ref → the Home-background room walker now shows hats/glasses.
- Home check: Home's large egg-zone `EggCanvas` (both eggsHatched>0 and ==0 branches) already rendered real equipped cosmetics — the app-level wrapper defaults `equipped` to `state.equipped`. No fix needed there; only the DecoratedRoom walker was missing cosmetics and is now fixed.
- Not finished: The WORLD MAP player sprite (`tileEngine.renderPlayer` via `window.__kq_companionEgg`, set in `WorldScreen.jsx`) still does NOT pass `equipped` to `renderEggSprite`, so cosmetics don't show on the map walker — out of this task's Home-focused scope. One-line follow-up if wanted.
- Blockers/risks found: Live browser verification blocked — no Chrome extension connected AND App gates all screens behind Supabase login (`App.jsx:84`, no guest bypass at the gate). Did not enter credentials. Verified via clean `npm run build` (168 modules) + a Node reducer/preview data-flow trace confirming: unowned tap never spends/persists, leaving resets to prior `state.equipped`, buy deducts+equips+drops preview, owned tap does real toggle, cross-slot preview keeps other equipped items, insufficient coins is a no-op.
- Ready to start next: Thread `equipped` into the world-map player sprite (WorldScreen `__kq_companionEgg` → renderEggSprite) for full cosmetics parity; or Phase 4 NPC System.
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Should map-walker cosmetics be added too (visual clutter at 16×16)? Otherwise nothing blocking.

**2026-06-30 (session 10) — Decorated room as Home background:**
- Built: `src/components/DecoratedRoom.jsx` — single-canvas room renderer: cream/wood gradient background, 12 furniture slots drawn via `item.draw()`, entity state machine (walk/idle/jump/spin) with `renderEggSprite` for the companion walker — all inside the room's floor area. Reads `state.roomLayout` via a ref updated every render so the RAF loop always sees the latest placement. Uses `useAppState()` + `useCompanion()` internally (self-contained). `Home.jsx`: `<HomeBackground>` removed, replaced with `<DecoratedRoom style={{ position:'absolute', inset:0, zIndex:-1 }}>` — Home background now shows the decorated room. `Room.jsx`: inline room scene (CSS gradient + EggCanvas) replaced with `<DecoratedRoom style={{ position:'absolute', inset:0 }}>` as visual base; transparent CSS grid overlay (12 slot divs, dashed/solid borders) layered on top as pure tap targets; `Slot` component removed; `EggCanvas` import removed; `SlotCanvas` + `ItemThumb` kept for picker modals. `HomeBackground.jsx` left in place (no longer imported). Build clean at 168 modules.
- Not finished: Nothing — spec complete. HomeBackground.jsx can be deleted in a future cleanup session.
- Blockers/risks: None.
- Ready to start next: Walker cosmetics (thread `state.equipped` into `renderEggSprite.js` so room walker + map walker show hats/glasses); or Phase 4 NPC System.
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Should the walker also show cosmetics (hats/glasses)? If yes, code path is clear.

**2026-06-30 (session 9) — Room / Den decoration system:**
- Built: `src/lib/roomItems.js` — 12 pixel-art furniture items (plant, rug, lamp, stuffed animal, window with curtains, small chair, desk, toy chest, bookshelf, wall art, bed, fish tank). Each `draw(ctx, cx, cy, sz)` draws a canvas-based pixel-art icon (no paths — fillRect only, consistent with egg cosmetics). Tiers: small 30–60 / mid 150–280 / big 500–600. `src/components/Room.jsx` — full Room screen: warm cream+wood room background (CSS gradient), 4×3 grid of 64px slots for placing furniture, companion EggCanvas standing in the lower center, tap empty slot → picker bottom sheet (owned-but-unplaced items), tap occupied slot → remove/swap action sheet, toast feedback. `src/components/Collection.jsx` — extended with top-level tabs (👗แต่งตัว | 🏠เฟอร์นิเจอร์); furniture tab shows 12 items with warm room-background preview, buy flow uses `BUY_ROOM_ITEM`. `src/components/BottomNav.jsx` — 5th tab "ห้อง" added (yellow→purple→green→blue→orange). `src/App.jsx` — added `screen === 'room'` + Room import. `src/lib/state.js` — `ownedRoomItems: []` + `roomLayout: {}` added to `defaultState()`. `src/context/StateContext.jsx` — `BUY_ROOM_ITEM` (deduct coins, add to ownedRoomItems), `PLACE_ROOM_ITEM` (set roomLayout[slotIndex]=itemId), `REMOVE_ROOM_ITEM` (delete slot from layout) — all 3 reducer cases. Build clean at 168 modules.
- Not finished: Nothing — spec complete. Multi-room expansion is future scope.
- Blockers/risks: None.
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System; or walker cosmetics (renderEggSprite)
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Nothing — room system is self-contained for now.

**2026-06-30 (session 8) — Cosmetic items (head + face), shop, and wardrobe:**
- Built: `src/egg/eggCosmeticLayer.js` — 18 pixel-art cosmetic items (10 head: bow, party hat, beanie, cap, headband stars, flower crown, top hat, wizard hat, gold crown, jeweled crown; 8 face: blush, freckles, flower cheek, mustache, round glasses, eye mask, sunglasses, star glasses). Exported `COSMETIC_ITEMS` catalog (id/slot/nameTh/nameEn/price/tier/draw) and `drawCosmetics(ctx, o, equipped)`. Wired into `src/egg/index.js` barrel export. `src/egg/EggCanvas.jsx` (core): added `equipped` prop (default null); `drawCosmetics` called as step 9 (before flash, inside pose transform), `equipped` added to useEffect dep array. `src/components/EggCanvas.jsx` (wrapper): imports `useAppState`, reads `state.equipped` by default, accepts `equipped` prop override (for shop previews). `src/lib/state.js`: added `ownedItems: []` and `equipped: { head: null, face: null }` to `defaultState()` — backfilled automatically for existing players via `{ ...defaultState(), ...saved }` spread. `src/context/StateContext.jsx`: added `BUY_ITEM` and `EQUIP_ITEM` actions + reducer cases (BUY_ITEM: deducts coins, adds to ownedItems, auto-equips; EQUIP_ITEM: toggles equipped[slot] — tap again to unequip). `src/components/Collection.jsx`: replaced coming-soon placeholder with full shop UI — coin balance header, HEAD/FACE tab switcher, 2-column item grid with per-item EggCanvas preview (showing that item equipped), tier badge, buy/equip/unequip buttons, toast feedback. All screens using `<EggCanvas>` (wrapper) automatically show equipped items — no per-screen changes needed. Build clean at 166 modules.
- Not finished: `renderEggSprite.js` walker (map/home canvas) does not show cosmetics — drawing cosmetics on the non-React walker requires threading `equipped` through `renderEggSprite` and `useWorldGameLoop`/`HomeBackground`. Deferred.
- Blockers/risks: None.
- Ready to start next: Wire cosmetics into `renderEggSprite.js` walker (simple — pass `equipped` to `drawCosmetics` after expression step); or Phase 4 NPC System
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Should the walker (map player sprite + home walker) also show hats/glasses? If yes, code path is clear and ready to implement.

**2026-06-30 (session 7) — Coins earned shown on all result screens:**
- Built: All 16 result/end screens now display the exact coins earned that round. `GameThai.jsx`: `useFinishRound` refactored to return `{ finish, coins }` — coins pre-computed before the closure, passed as `coins` prop to `ResultScreen`. `GameMath`, `GameShop`, `GameMathBattle`: added `coinsEarned` state, set before dispatch, shown in inline done screens. `GamePhonics`: `ResultScreen` gains `coins` prop; all 4 sub-games (PhonicsGame L1, CVCGame L2, SightGame L3, SentenceGame L4) add `coinsEarned` state. Minigames: EggMemory/EggFishing hardcoded +5; EggTower/EggCatch display computed from `score` state (deterministic, same formula); EggRun badge in canvas dead overlay from `gsRef.ringCount`. WorldBattle: `pendingBattleCoins` state set alongside dispatch, passed to `<RewardChest coins={...}>`; RewardChest shows animated gold pill in reveal phase. Build clean at 165 modules.
- Not finished: Nothing — all screens covered.
- Blockers/risks: None.
- Ready to start next: Coin spending system (shop/wearable items) — Chatbot must define what coins buy first
- Needs Chatbot decision first: What can coins buy? What does the shop UI look like? Any daily coin cap?

**2026-06-27 (session 6) — Coin economy (earn-only foundation):**
- Built: Added `coins`, `lastLoginDate`, `loginStreak`, `coinsLevelBonus` to `defaultState()` + `migrateStateShape()` (existing players load with `coins: 0`). Added `ADD_COINS` and `DAILY_LOGIN` reducer actions. Hooked coin awards at: all ROUND_COMPLETE paths in GameThai (via `useFinishRound`), GameMath, GamePhonics (all 4 sub-games), GameShop, GameMathBattle; world battle win (+10 regular / +15 boss, in `WorldBattle.onComplete`); arcade minigame completions (EggMemory +5, EggTower score-scaled 3–8, EggRun ring-scaled 3–8, EggCatch score-scaled 3–8, EggFishing +5). Level-unlock first-time bonus (+15, guarded by `coinsLevelBonus[world_level]` flag — no re-award). Daily login (+10 + min(streak,5) each new calendar day). Coin HUD added to Home.jsx header (gold 🪙 badge). `showItemToast` used for all coin feedback. Formula: `round(12 × accuracy × (1-mastery))`, clamp [2,12]. Anti-farm: replaying mastered level → min 2 coins/round. Build clean at 165 modules.
- Not finished: No spending, no shop, no items linked to coins — earn-only as specified.
- Blockers/risks found: `showItemToast` in StateContext.jsx (daily login) uses 900ms setTimeout to let ItemToast component register. If app loads very slowly, toast might fire before registry. Acceptable for now.
- Ready to start next: Coin spending system (shop/wearable items) — next session after design from Chatbot
- Needs Chatbot decision first: What can coins buy? What's the shop UI? Any daily coin cap?

**2026-06-27 (session 5) — Legacy creature art removal STEP 2+2.5+§3+§4:**
- Built: Deleted BattleScreen.jsx, HatchOverlay.jsx, CreatureCanvas.jsx, drawCreature.js, creatureAlgorithm.js, creatureHelpers.js (all zero-caller verified). Replaced: LoginBackdrop.jsx → 9 random-element egg RAF sprites (renderEggSprite); EggMemory.jsx → 6 emoji card pairs (🔥💧⚡🌿🌑✨, no creature dependency). Removed dead WorldHUD globals (__kq_activeCreatureSeed/__kq_activeCreatureStats + getCreatureSeed import). Removed dead HatchOverlay import/JSX from App.jsx. Removed dead getCreatureForHatch import from StateContext.jsx. Created db_backups/get_mystery_adventurers.OLD.sql with backup note + retrieval instructions. Build clean at 165 modules.
- Not finished: `get_mystery_adventurers` RPC migration still not applied (supabase/migrations/20260627_mystery_adventurers_egg.sql must be run in Supabase SQL Editor). STEP 3 (DB column/RPC-body drops) not started.
- Blockers/risks found: The db_backups file is a placeholder — user should run `SELECT pg_get_functiondef('get_mystery_adventurers'::regproc)` in Supabase SQL Editor and save the real definition before applying the migration.
- Ready to start next: Apply the RPC migration SQL in Supabase SQL Editor → test FriendsScreen Mystery Adventurers tab; then Phase 4 NPC System
- Needs Chatbot decision first: STEP 3 (actual DB column drops on hatchedEggs blob fields) — user must give explicit OK after verifying backup

**2026-06-27 (session 4) — Full-pipeline animated walkers + Mystery Adventurers egg upgrade:**
- Built: Created `src/egg/renderEggSprite.js` — shared non-React helper running the full 9-step egg compositing pipeline (aura→pose→regalia→body→eyes→expression). Updated `HomeBackground.jsx` to call `renderEggSprite` per-frame into a reused 48×48 offscreen (`basePxOverride=2`); element animations are now live. Updated `WorldScreen.jsx` to set `window.__kq_companionEgg` (not a baked canvas); updated `tileEngine.renderPlayer` to call `renderEggSprite` per-frame into a 32×32 offscreen scaled to 16×16. Removed `drawCreature` from tileEngine. Updated `FriendsScreen.jsx` MysteryTab: `<EggCanvasCore>` per adventurer row/modal; removed `CreatureCanvas`/`ELEMENT_STATS`/`elementToStats`/`drawCreature`. Generated `supabase/migrations/20260627_mystery_adventurers_egg.sql` for new RPC returning `element/eye/gender/stage/...`. Build clean at 170 modules.
- Not finished: Supabase migration for `get_mystery_adventurers` NOT yet applied — adventurers will show default egg (fire/gba/male/stage1) until migration runs
- Blockers/risks found: Migration must be pasted and run at https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dgpsnlkedergkbhqnjpu/sql
- Ready to start next: Run the migration SQL, then test FriendsScreen in browser; or BattleScreen.jsx dead-code deletion; or Phase 4 NPC System
- Needs Chatbot decision first: none

**2026-06-27 — Companion egg walker on Home; Collection placeholder:**
- Built: `HomeBackground.jsx` rewritten — single companion egg entity (walk/jump/spin) using `drawEggBody`+`drawEyeLayer` to 48×48 offscreen canvas; `Home.jsx` passes `companion={resolved}` + `stage` from `useCompanion()`; voice profile now derived from companion element/gender (no DNA). `Collection.jsx` replaced with "เร็วๆ นี้!" placeholder (companion EggCanvas + coming-soon copy). `CreatureDetailPopup.jsx` deleted (orphaned). Build clean at 169 modules.
- Not finished: none
- Blockers/risks found: `HomeBackground` now shows only 1 entity (the companion); the old "meeting gimmick" between multiple walkers is gone — intentional
- Ready to start next: FriendsScreen MysteryTab rework (replace `drawCreature` + `get_mystery_adventurers` with companion EggCanvas); or BattleScreen.jsx deletion (orphaned); or WorldHUD `getCreatureSeed` dead-code removal
- Needs Chatbot decision first: Full Collection redesign (shop/cosmetics/room) — placeholder only for now

**2026-06-26 (session 2) — Companion egg shown on all screens; name = child's account name:**
- Built: Replaced `drawCreature` canvas with `EggCanvas` on Home (large display + party bar), Collection (PartyGrid), PartySelect, and Battle (player side). Name `state.name` shown everywhere instead of `creatureName`. Map player sprite: WorldScreen pre-renders companion egg body+eyes to `window.__kq_playerOffscreen` (32×32); `tileEngine.renderPlayer` uses it. Build passes. Deployed to Vercel.
- Not finished: none — all 5 screens done
- Blockers/risks found: none
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System; or companion aura progression (aura shown based on stage)
- Needs Chatbot decision first: none

**2026-06-26 — Living Egg renderer + one-time Companion Creation:**
- Built: Full `src/egg/` layer system wired into a new `EggCanvas.jsx` React component (RAF loop, DPR-backed canvas, 11-step compositing pipeline). Created `CompanionContext` (loads `companions` row from Supabase, exposes `resolved`/`loading`/`createCompanion`). Created blocking `CompanionCreation` modal (element × 6, eye × 4 with mini previews, gender × 2; live full preview; confirm dialog; Thai UI). Replaced `src/components/EggCanvas.jsx` with a thin wrapper that reads from CompanionContext and accepts legacy `stats` prop — all existing callers untouched. Added companion gate to `App.jsx` (waits for `companionLoading` before showing loading screen; blocks on `!companion` after onboarding). Wrapped app with `CompanionProvider` in `main.jsx`. Created `supabase/migrations/20260626_companions.sql` with DDL + RLS + `create_companion` RPC.
- Not finished: Supabase migration NOT yet applied — must be run manually in the Supabase SQL Editor before companion creation works in production.
- Blockers/risks found: No Supabase CLI available, no service_role key — migration must be pasted and run by hand at https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dgpsnlkedergkbhqnjpu/sql

**2026-06-22 — baby-stage Minecraft voxel/cube aesthetic redesign:**
- Built: Pivoted all 4 baby draw functions from organic/Pokémon-style curves to Minecraft mob voxel style. Each type now has one unmistakable Minecraft-style face feature: FURRED = large 4×2 pig snout block with 2 nostril dots at face bottom (Minecraft pig); WINGED = 4×1 accent crest bar at face top + 2×1 accent beak at face bottom (Minecraft chicken), wings as 4×4 panels spanning canvas edges; SCALED = 2×3 side frill blocks at extreme head edges (x=0 and x=10) + 1×2 slit pupils + 3×3 tail block (lizard/turtle style); CHITIN = compound eyes in accent color protruding outside head (Minecraft spider red-eye style), three-segment widening body 6→8→10. All shapes are pure flat rectangles, bigger/fewer than before, with face as the dominant feature.

**2026-06-22 — baby-stage silhouette redesign (block-attachment technique, corrected from diagonal-curve approach):**
- Built: Rewrote all 4 baby-stage draw functions in `creatureAlgorithm.js` using block-attachment silhouette technique derived from Pokémon reference images. Key correction: previous pass wrongly used staircase/diagonal pixels; reference sprites use almost exclusively rectangular blocks with at most 1px step offsets. Per-type changes — FURRED: ears now 2-wide × 3-tall proper ear blocks (was 3×1 thin horizontal bar), head 10-wide with 6-wide body for chibi proportion, tail is flat 3×2 rectangle (was staircase), 4 leg stubs clearly separated. WINGED: wings are pure 3×4 rectangular blocks attached to body sides with consistent 2-wide fill throughout all 4 rows (no taper), 2-stub bipedal legs. SCALED: head enlarged to 8×5 (was 6×4), side frills as 2×3 blocks protruding sideways, tail is straight 2×5 vertical rectangle (no staircase), right leg shifted to x=6 to avoid merging with tail at x=9. CHITIN: antennae shortened to 2 rows (head starts at y=2), compound eyes still protruding 1px outside head shell, 3-segment widening body 6→8→10 intact.

- Needs Chatbot decision first: none

**2026-06-21 — baby-stage quality pass (Pokémon-reference-informed):**
- Built: All 4 baby draw functions redesigned with reference-quality pixel-art techniques. (1) DARK OUTLINE everywhere — every shape uses "draw dark shell 1px larger, then fill on top" so a 1px dark border appears around every body region. (2) HEAD-TO-BODY FLOW — FURRED: 10-wide head shell → matching-width shoulder bridge row (primary, y=6) → body steps in 1px each side; WINGED: 8-wide head steps to 6-wide body at y=6; SCALED: head and body share same x-range so outline runs continuously; CHITIN: each segment's dark shell is 2px wider than the one above (6→8→10) creating a staircase widening. (3) DIAGONAL PIXELS — FURRED tail = 2-step stair-step arc; WINGED wing nubs = 3×3 dark block with fill tapering from 2-wide to 1-wide (left/right edges step diagonally); SCALED tail = straight column then 1-px rightward bend. (4) EYES — all 4 types now draw 2×2 dark eye block with explicit `r(x,y,1,1,'#ffffff')` white shine at upper-left. Chitin compound eyes moved to x=2/x=9 (1×2 tall, truly outside the head dark shell). Scaled baby spot/stripe overlay coordinates updated (old positions landed on dark-border row y=8 and leg zone y=9).
- Not finished: teen and final stage quality pass (baby approved first)
- Blockers/risks found: none
- Ready to start next: teen+final stage quality pass (same 4 techniques, extend to the other 8 draw functions) — OR — Phase 4 NPC System
- Needs Chatbot decision first: which to do next — creature quality pass on remaining stages, or move to NPC system?

**2026-06-20 — creatureAlgorithm.js silhouette redesign (round 4 — chibi pixel-art principles):**
- Built: Full rewrite of all 12 draw functions using chibi pixel-art proportion principles. FURRED: BIG ROUND HEAD is the focal feature — head 8-wide, ears add 3 rows above; body NARROWER (6-wide) than head to emphasise chibi dome; 4 stub legs; mane crown at final with accent shimmer. WINGED: no ears (smooth dome top), head 6-wide (narrower than furred), eyes HIGH on face (avian), body only 4-wide; wing focal feature grows: shoulder nubs → folded wings in accent colour → fully spread accent wings spanning canvas edges; 2 legs only (bipedal). SCALED: flat-top head (no bumps), side frills protrude sideways, SLIT EYES (1×2 vertical vs 2×2 round), tail IS the focal feature — tiny with no accent at baby → accent tip at teen → large 3-row bold accent block at final. CHITIN: 3-band stacked structure (4→6→8 wide) at all stages; antennae single-pixel thin; compound eyes bulge 1px beyond head width; accent used for wings only — absent at baby, wing buds at teen, full spread wings at final with accent ring on abdomen. Pattern overlays (spots/stripes) updated to match new body layouts.
- Not finished: nothing
- Blockers/risks found: none — visual test recommended in browser with seeds 3=furred, 17=winged, 33=scaled, 49=chitin
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System (5 NPCs: Prof Owl already wired; add Grandma Turtle, Clover Kid, Crystal Fairy, Sleepy Mole)
- Needs Chatbot decision first: none

**2026-06-20 — creatureAlgorithm.js silhouette redesign (round 3 — Pokémon-proportion):**
- Built: Reverted all stages to 12×12 grid (removed 16×16 final). Redesigned all 12 draw functions using proportion-based differentiation. FURRED: wide quadruped (10-12 wide body, 4-leg pairs with belly gap, triangular ears; baby=stub tail, teen=shoulder mane tufts, final=mane crown). WINGED: narrow bipedal (4 wide body, 2 legs only, beak, tail extending right; baby=tiny wing nubs, teen=folded wing buds, final=wings spread to canvas edges). SCALED: round compact (Squirtle proportion, dorsal ridge above head instead of ears, slit eyes, arm stubs + 2 bottom legs; baby=small frill, teen=head-side frills, final=large dramatic corner frills). CHITIN: 3 stacked segments (head smallest→thorax medium→abdomen largest; antennae always, legs from thorax only; baby=4 legs, teen=6 legs+wing buds, final=full wings+pincers). Draw order fixed: beak and tongue drawn AFTER body so they appear on top.
- Not finished: nothing
- Blockers/risks found: none — visual test needed in browser; test seeds 3=furred, 17=winged, 33=scaled, 49=chitin (small sequential seeds cluster to furred in prng)

- Needs Chatbot decision first: none

**2026-06-20 — creatureAlgorithm.js silhouette redesign (round 2):**
- Built: Fundamentally different architecture per body type. FURRED = 4-legged quadruped stance (4 legs in two pairs with belly gap). WINGED = wings dominate width (canvas-edge to canvas-edge on final), beak, 2 taloned feet, fan tail feathers. SCALED = HORIZONTAL for baby/teen (head left, tail right, frills on left edge, horizontal body — completely unique orientation vs other types); final is standing 2-legged serpent dragon. CHITIN = 3 stacked segments where abdomen is LARGEST (true insect proportion), thin antennae, legs radiate from thorax. Final stage uses 16×16 grid for more detail. Squint test passes — all 4 types readable in silhouette alone.

**2026-06-20 — creatureAlgorithm.js full visual redesign:**
- Built: 4 body types (`furred`/`winged`/`scaled`/`chitin`) × 3 stages = 12 hand-placed silhouettes on 12×12 pixel grid. 20 palette variants across 6 elements (3–4 per element). Pattern overlay system: `none`/`spots`/`stripes` (50%/25%/25%). All driven by `prng(seed)` — 3 consecutive draws: palette index → body type → pattern. `COLORS` → `PALETTES` (array-of-objects per element). `getElement()`, `getCreatureSeed()`, `drawCreature()` signature all unchanged. Visually reviewed in browser — 4 body types clearly distinct (furred=cat ears, winged=wing protrusions+beak, scaled=side frills+tongue, chitin=antennae+segmented). Stage evolution (baby→teen→final) clearly readable.
- Not finished: nothing
- Blockers/risks found: prng(seed) with small sequential seeds (1–16) clusters to furred body type. Real creature seeds are hash-of-name×date so they span 32-bit space — distribution is fine in practice. Test seeds needed to be chosen from different clusters to verify all 4 types.

**2026-06-20 — Phase 1.1c — Mystery Adventurers: real procedural creature rendering:**
- Built: `ELEMENT_STATS` reverse-map (6 entries) + `elementToStats(element, evoStage)` — derives placeholder xp/acc/streak values that route `getElement()` to the correct element without touching `creatureAlgorithm.js`. Used option (a) as specified. `CreatureCanvas` component (canvas + useEffect) calls `drawCreature(canvas, Number(seed), elementToStats(...))`. Card: 64×64 canvas replaces emoji placeholder. Modal: 192×192 canvas replaces emoji placeholder. Both still show creature_name text label. No changes to any lib file.
- Not finished: nothing
- Blockers/risks found: creature_seed from Supabase is a bigint — `Number(seed)` coerces it safely for values within 32-bit range (hash function output); no precision loss expected
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System

**2026-06-20 — Phase 1.1b — Mystery Adventurers: creature stats + rarity cards:**
- Built: `RARITY` 5-tier color map; `RarityBadge` component (rarity-colored border/bg/glow); `StatBar` component (reuses `.px-hp-bar-outer/.px-hp-bar-inner` CSS, pixel font label, numeric value). `AdventurerModal` (createPortal): opens on "ดูสเตตัส" tap; 72px emoji avatar with rarity border; creature_name + badge; masked display_name; 4 stat bars with fixed max refs (HP/300, ATK/80, DEF/60, SPD/300); "ท้าเล่น" closes modal + fires 3s toast. Card updated: rarity-colored border + optional glow; 48×48 emoji avatar; creature_name + badge + display_name info; "ดูสเตตัส" button. source field intentionally ignored — player/bot cards look identical.
- Not finished: nothing
- Blockers/risks found: stat max reference values (HP 300, ATK 80, DEF 60, SPD 300) are estimates — Chatbot should confirm if bar scaling looks wrong with real data
- Ready to start next: Phase 4 NPC System
- Needs Chatbot decision first: none

**2026-06-20 — Phase 1.1 — Unified Friends screen + Mystery Adventurers tab:**
- Built: FriendsScreen.jsx fully rewritten. Tab bar reduced from 4 → 2 tabs (เพื่อน / ผู้คนอื่นๆ). FriendsTab: single scrollable page loading all data in parallel (Promise.all: friendships + ensure_friend_code + my_friends); pending requests section only renders when requests.length > 0 (no empty state); My Code / Add Friend / Friends list sections always shown. All RPC calls, message logic, and error handling preserved unchanged from Phase 1. MysteryTab: calls get_mystery_adventurers({ p_limit: 8 }) on mount; 8 adventurer cards with display_name + ⚔️ icon (player/bot look identical); "ท้าเล่น" = mock toast for 3s (no backend call); "🔄 สับใหม่" button re-calls RPC. Toast is fixed-positioned at top:60, zIndex:9999.
- Not finished: nothing
- Blockers/risks found: get_mystery_adventurers return shape assumed as array of { display_name, source } — source field intentionally ignored in rendering

**Status:** Database migration is DONE and deployed to production Supabase project `kidquest`.
**Your job:** Implement the React frontend that calls these existing tables/functions. Do NOT write any SQL or modify the database — it's already live.

---

## What already exists in Supabase (do not recreate)

### Tables

- `public.friend_codes` — `user_id` (PK, FK→auth.users), `code` (text, unique, 6 chars), `created_at`
- `public.friendships` — `id` (PK uuid), `requester_id`, `target_id`, `status` ('pending'|'accepted'|'rejected'), `created_at`, `responded_at`

### View

- `public.my_friends` — already filtered by RLS to the logged-in user. Columns: `friendship_id`, `friend_user_id`, `friend_name`, `created_at`, `responded_at`. Only contains `status = 'accepted'` rows.

### RPC functions (call via `supabase.rpc(...)`)

1. **`ensure_friend_code(p_user_id uuid)`** → returns `text` (the code)
   - Idempotent. Call once right after a user's first egg is created.
   - Generates a permanent 6-char code (charset excludes O/0, I/1, L — kid-safe, no ambiguous chars).

2. **`send_friend_request(p_code text)`** → returns table `(friendship_id uuid, status text)`
   - The ONLY way to look up another user — by exact code match.
   - Handles: code not found (raises exception), self-friend attempt (raises exception), existing pending/accepted relationship (returns existing row instead of duplicating).
   - Auth required (`auth.uid()` used internally as requester).

3. **`respond_friend_request(p_friendship_id uuid, p_accept boolean)`** → returns `text` (new status: 'accepted' or 'rejected')
   - Only callable by the `target_id` of a pending request.
   - Raises exception if not authorized or already resolved.

### Direct table reads (RLS-protected, safe to query directly)

- `select * from friend_codes where user_id = auth.uid()` → get my own code to display
- `select * from friendships where target_id = auth.uid() and status = 'pending'` → incoming requests to show "Accept/Reject" UI for
- `select * from friendships where requester_id = auth.uid() and status = 'pending'` → outgoing requests I'm waiting on (show "Pending..." state)
- `select * from my_friends` → my accepted friends list

---

## UI / UX requirements

**Core safety rule: no browsing, no search, no user list anywhere.** The only way to add a friend is typing in a code given to you outside the app (verbally, or shown by the friend on their own screen).

### Screens to build

1. **My Code screen** (in profile/settings area)
   - Big, friendly display of the user's own code (e.g. large pixel-font text, maybe with a "copy" button)
   - Call `ensure_friend_code` on mount if no code is cached yet, otherwise just read from `friend_codes`
   - Simple flavor text like "Share this code with a friend so they can add you!"

2. **Add Friend screen**
   - 6-character input (auto-uppercase, restrict to the kid-safe charset if you want client-side validation, but server is authoritative)
   - Submit → `send_friend_request(code)`
   - Handle responses:
     - success + status 'pending' → show "Request sent! Waiting for them to accept."
     - success + status 'accepted' (already friends) → show "You're already friends!"
     - error "Code not found" → friendly "Hmm, that code doesn't match anyone. Double-check it!"
     - error "Cannot friend yourself" → friendly "That's your own code, silly!"

3. **Friend Requests screen** (incoming)
   - List rows from `friendships` where `target_id = me` and `status = 'pending'`
   - For each: show requester's name (you'll need to join/fetch `eggs.child_name` for `requester_id`, since `my_friends` view only covers accepted ones — either extend a similar view or do a client-side fetch per row)
   - Accept / Reject buttons → `respond_friend_request(id, true/false)`
   - On accept, refresh the friends list

4. **My Friends screen**
   - Query `my_friends` view directly
   - Show as a simple list/grid with friend names (pixel UI style, consistent with rest of KidQuest)
   - This is also where future features (compare creatures, visit, battle a friend, etc.) would hook in — not in scope for Phase 1, just display for now

### Visual style

Follow existing KidQuest pixel art conventions: Press Start 2P font (English), Sarabun (Thai), hard shadows, zero border-radius, no soft gradients.

---

## Edge cases to handle gracefully

- User has no code yet (new account, first session) → auto-generate via `ensure_friend_code` before showing "Add Friend" or "My Code" screens
- Network/RPC errors → don't crash, show a simple retry-friendly message (this is a kids' app — never show raw error text or stack traces)
- Empty states: no friends yet, no pending requests yet — both need friendly empty-state copy/illustration, not a blank screen

## Explicitly out of scope for this phase

- No friend-vs-friend battles yet
- No chat/messaging between friends
- No "remove friend" UI yet (can be added later — table supports it via a future delete/status policy, not built yet)
- No leaderboards or friend comparison screens yet

---

## Reference: full SQL already deployed

See `friend_system_migration.sql` (already run in Supabase SQL Editor, production). If you need to double check exact column names or constraints, that file is the source of truth — do not re-run it, just reference it.
