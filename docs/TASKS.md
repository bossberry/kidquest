# Tasks — KidQuest

## Now

- [x] **Home 2.0 — Adventure Director** — `Home.jsx` rewritten: single `⭐ ผจญภัยต่อ` recommendation card (deterministic: hatch → shop first run → weakest subject); minigames 2×2 grid replaced with `🎁 เซอร์ไพรส์วันนี้` single event rotation (date-hash from unlocked minigames; sessionLog marks played-today). Bug fixes: Report NaN for avgScore/avgDur/avgHints (safe migration defaults). Build ✅.
- [x] **Egg economy source-of-truth doc** — `docs/research/rewards/egg-economy.md` created; RESEARCH_INDEX.md updated; GPT_NOTES.md updated with economy decisions.
- [x] **Observation philosophy source-of-truth doc** — `docs/research/observation/observation-philosophy.md` created. Covers: observe→understand→design loop, children are not their level, positive interpretation, important vs. dominating signals, Subject Readiness as observation not label, parent report philosophy (no anxiety), mission follows child, explicit non-goals (no AI/ranking/manipulation), system relationships, 5 open questions. RESEARCH_INDEX.md, GPT_NOTES.md updated.
- [x] **Gameplay loop source-of-truth doc** — `docs/research/progression/gameplay-loop.md` created. Highest-level philosophy document. Covers: core loop (learn→battle→learn), Home as Adventure Director (not a menu), replay philosophy, surprise philosophy, minigame philosophy, intrinsic motivation, child autonomy, explicit non-goals, system relationships, 5 open questions. RESEARCH_INDEX.md, GPT_NOTES.md updated.
- [x] **Battle progression source-of-truth doc** — `docs/research/battle/battle-progression.md` created. Covers: core loop (learn→battle→learn), battle as reward not primary game, creature philosophy, enemy scaling (gentle, Challenger every 15 rounds), loss philosophy (no permanent penalties), reward design, frequency (self-directed), non-goals, future features, relationships to other systems, 5 open questions. RESEARCH_INDEX.md, GPT_NOTES.md updated.
- [x] **Subject progression source-of-truth doc** — `docs/research/progression/subject-progression.md` created. Covers: core philosophy (subjects primary, missions secondary), progression flow, unlock thresholds (70/80/90), replay always valid, mastery = confidence not perfection, subject independence, stretch/challenge layers, readiness vs. highest level, non-goals, future grades. RESEARCH_INDEX.md, GPT_NOTES.md updated.
- [x] **Creature stats source-of-truth doc** — `docs/research/battle/creature-stats.md` created. Covers: weighted stat philosophy, why one-subject-one-stat is bad, example weightings (HP/ATK/DEF/SPD/CRIT), personality variation (±10% deterministic), migration rules, non-goals, future scaling. RESEARCH_INDEX.md, GPT_NOTES.md, TASKS.md updated.
- [x] **Egg pacing + creature stat rebalance** — `scaledEggProgress()` in StateContext (required = min(800, 120 + n×60)); `calcCreatureStats()` weighted formula (40% base + 60% weighted — no stat ever 0); migration recalculates 0/NaN stats. Build ✅.
- [x] **Shop feedback + hatch overlay fix** — `GameShop.jsx`: wrong-button shake (`.wrong` CSS), streak fire messages, prominent streak counter. `HatchOverlay.jsx`: freeze fixed (`setPhase('tapping')` in handleClose), mid-game auto-trigger suppressed via `suppressAutoOpen` prop. `App.jsx`: `suppressAutoOpen={screen === 'game'}`. Build ✅.
- [x] **Battle Home experience** — ⚔️ badge removed from BottomNav. Battle card added to Adventure Director (priority: hatch → battle → shop → weakest subject). Shows challenger emoji + "มอนสเตอร์ปรากฏตัว!" on dark gradient card. Tapping opens ChallengerOverlay (visible state lifted to App.jsx). Build ✅.
- [x] **Shop Mission speech feedback** — `speakTh`/`speakEn` added to `GameShop.jsx`. After each correct answer: Thai questions speak the Thai word (380ms delay), English speaks the English word, Math/counting speaks Thai number word (หนึ่ง/สอง/...). Sound toggle respected. Build ✅.
- [x] **Home UI simplification** — Subject grid now collapsible behind "อยากเลือกเอง?" toggle (closed by default). Shop Mission card removed from main Home. Visual hierarchy: Egg → Continue Adventure → "อยากเลือกเอง?" → Egg Run → Surprise. Build ✅.
- [x] **Battle balance and sound** — enemy HP ×4, ATK ×2.5; battles last 6–15 turns. BattleScreen sound respects toggle; attack/hit/crit/win/lose SFX improved. Build ✅.
- [x] **Battle learning special move** — question phase before each battle (Thai/Math/English from existing content). Correct → ⚡ special attack fires (25% bonus damage, special SFX, gold flash). Wrong/skip → no penalty. Subject chosen from most-played in sessionLog; falls back to simple Math. Also fixed ATK/DEF advice text mismatch in result screen. Build ✅.
- [x] **Audio polish + louder phonics** — 9 new playTone types (tap, open, unlock, item, eggReady, reveal, start, complete, cardOpen). Phonics GainNode 2.5 → 4.0. Sounds wired to Home (tap/open/eggReady), Collection (cardOpen/close), HatchOverlay (reveal), BattleScreen (item), GameShop/Math/Thai/Phonics (unlock, complete). Build ✅.
- [x] **Animation juice polish** — 10 new CSS keyframe animations + utility classes across styles.css. Wired to Home (card float/pulse/shimmer, grid slide-in), BattleScreen (victory bounce, item pop, special-move glow), HatchOverlay (creature reveal glow), GameShop (done bounce, streak bounce). `prefers-reduced-motion` respected. Build ✅.
- [x] **Math Battle learning mode MVP** — `GameMathBattle.jsx` created. 8-question battle vs cute enemy (🤖👻😈🐲). Correct → attack flash + HP drain. Streak≥3 → Crit × 1.5. Wrong → gentle bump, no player HP loss. Same XP/sessionLog/UNLOCK_LEVEL dispatches as GameMath. Continue Adventure Math card routes to battle mode. Subject grid Math card still routes to normal GameMath. Build ✅.
- [x] **Battle special move timing + accessibility** — Prompt moved to mid-battle surprise (after turn 2-3). Questions are emoji-visual: counting emojis for Math, TTS word + emoji choices for Thai/English. 🔊 replay button. Correct fires special SFX + ท่าพิเศษ. Wrong/Skip = no penalty. Build ✅.
- [x] **Subject Adventure Engine MVP** — GameSubjectAdventure.jsx + BattleMode/ChaseMode/DefenseMode. Mode rotates deterministically by day+playCount. All 3 subjects. TTS on Thai/English. XP/sessionLog/level-unlock identical to classic games. Continue Adventure now routes to adventure-{world}. Classic games still accessible. Build ✅.
- [ ] **Play Math Battle with Chopin** — Is the battle mode more engaging? Does Chopin prefer it over normal Math? How many questions feel right (8)? Report to GPT_NOTES.md.
- [ ] **Play Shop Mission with Chopin** — validate fun and timing before expanding. Target: 2–3 min, 80% pass on first or second run.
- [ ] **D0: Home UX audit** — review simplified Home with Chopin. Does Continue Adventure feel like the obvious action? Does the "อยากเลือกเอง?" toggle feel discoverable?
- [x] **Egg Companion Adventure design doc** — `docs/research/gameplay/egg-companion-adventure.md` created. Covers: egg as emotional companion (not just progress bar), companion framing per mode (DefenseMode highest impact), visual/audio/progress spec, relationship data fields (adventuresWith/questionsAnswered/daysTogetherCount/favoriteSubject), MVP recommendation, 5 open questions for GPT.

## Development Workflow (required every session that changes app code)

```
1. npm run build          → confirm zero errors before committing
2. git add <files>        → stage specific files (never git add -A blindly)
3. git commit             → meaningful message
4. git push origin main   → triggers Vercel auto-deploy
5. Open production URL    → verify the change is live and working
6. Update docs            → CURRENT_STATE, TASKS, CHANGELOG, GPT_HANDOFF (same commit or next commit)
```

Vercel auto-deploys from every push to `main`. There is no manual deploy step.
Production URL: check `vercel.json` or Vercel dashboard for the live URL.
