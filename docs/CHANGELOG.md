## 2026-06-04 — Egg pacing + creature stat rebalance

### Part 1 — Egg progression pacing
- `src/context/StateContext.jsx` — `scaledEggProgress(state)` helper added (module-level). Computes `required = min(800, 120 + hatchedEggs.length * 60)`, divides into 7 stages dynamically, returns `{stage, stageXP, pct, xpPerStage, required}`. `ADD_XP` reducer: replaced static `newStage`-based `readyToHatch` with `newTotal >= hatchRequired` (dynamic). `derived` useMemo: `eggProgressData` now uses `scaledEggProgress()`; `eggStatsData.stage` overridden to scaled stage so `drawEgg()` visual matches progress display. `state.hatchedEggs` added to useMemo deps.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — destructures `xpPerStage` from `eggProgressData`; egg XP label updated: shows "เกือบฟักแล้ว!" in stage 6 before ready, uses dynamic `xpPerStage` denominator instead of hardcoded 50.

### Part 2 — Creature battle stat rebalance
- `src/config/gameConfig.js` — `calcCreatureStats()` rewritten with weighted formula. Old: ATK=base×thaiShare (exclusive ownership — ATK=0 if no Thai XP). New: every stat has 40% base guarantee + 60% subject-weighted. HP: 1.5+0.3t+0.1m+0.1e; ATK: 0.4+0.3m+0.2e+0.1t; DEF: 0.4+0.3t+0.2m+0.1e; SPD: 0.4+0.3e+0.2m+0.1t. Deterministic ±5% personality variation from XP seed. Minimum possible any stat = base × 0.5 (Thai-only learner) — no more 0 stats.
- `src/lib/state.js` — `_migrateEggs()` updated: recalculates stats if any of ATK/DEF/SPD is 0 or NaN (covers pre-rebalance eggs with broken stats).
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Shop feedback + hatch overlay fix

- `src/games/GameShop.jsx` — feedback improvements:
  - `wrongChoice` state added; `.wrong` CSS class (shake animation) applied to the wrong button on incorrect answer. Cleared on correct / next / replay.
  - `STREAK_MSGS` array added; when streak ≥ 3 feedback message uses fire messages instead of generic correct msg.
  - Streak counter in header styled amber bold at ≥ 3 (was muted/small).
  - Wrong feedback text changed from "ไม่ถูก ลองอีกครั้ง! 🤔" to "ลองอีกครั้ง! 💪"; reveal message now friendlier: `คำตอบที่ถูกคือ "${q.answer}" 😊`.
  - All existing `playTone` calls unchanged.
- `src/components/HatchOverlay.jsx` — two bug fixes:
  - **Freeze fix**: `setPhase('tapping')` called as first line of `handleClose()`. After dispatch+navigate, `isOpen` is `false` and `phase` is `'tapping'` → condition `!isOpen && phase === 'tapping'` is true → overlay unmounts cleanly. No more frozen screen requiring refresh.
  - **Mid-game interruption fix**: `suppressAutoOpen` prop (default false). When `true`, `isOpen` ignores `readyToHatch && !hatched` auto-trigger. Only explicit `state.hatching` (user-initiated) can open overlay.
- `src/App.jsx` — passes `suppressAutoOpen={screen === 'game'}` to `HatchOverlay`. During gameplay, hatch overlay won't auto-interrupt. After returning to home, `readyToHatch` is still true → overlay appears normally.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Home 2.0: Adventure Director + NaN bug fixes

- `src/components/Home.jsx` — rewritten as Adventure Director.
  - **`⭐ ผจญภัยต่อ`** section: single large recommended card above the world grid. Deterministic priority: (1) hatch if egg ready, (2) Shop if never played, (3) weakest subject by XP. No AI, no state.
  - **`🎁 เซอร์ไพรส์วันนี้`** section: replaces the 2×2 minigame grid. One unlocked minigame shown per day (date-hash mod count of unlocked games). After playing, shows "เล่นแล้ว! มาพรุ่งนี้นะ 🌙" (derived from `sessionLog`, no new state). If no minigames unlocked yet, shows a teaser card.
  - World-label text changed to "หรือเลือกเรียน" (secondary framing).
  - `getRecommendation()` and `getSurpriseEvent()` helper functions added (module-level, no hooks).
- `src/components/Report.jsx` — **NaN bug fixes** in `MissionAnalytics`:
  - `totalHints = 0`, `totalDuration = 0` default values added to destructuring (handles pre-Phase-D state with no analytics fields).
  - `avgScore` now returns `null` when `totalQs === 0` (renders as `—` not `0%`).
  - `avgDur` now returns `null` when `totalDuration === 0` (renders as `—` not `NaN`).
  - `nudge` guard updated: `avgScore !== null && avgScore >= 90`.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-04 — Subject Readiness Report display

- `src/components/Report.jsx` — `computeReadiness(sessionLog, world)` added: filters last 10 `sessionLog` entries per world, derives one of 4 states (strong / comfortable / exploring / notready) from avgScore + goodRuns + completionRate thresholds. `SubjectReadiness` component renders a card with color-coded Thai-language badges for ภาษาไทย / คณิต / อังกฤษ. Observation footnote: "ดูจากการเล่นล่าสุด ไม่ใช่เลเวลที่ปลดล็อก". No new state fields.
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-03 — Subject Readiness Design (docs only)

- `docs/research/observation/play-observation-system.md` — **Subject Readiness** section added: 4 readiness states (Strong / Comfortable / Exploring / Not Ready), derivation logic (last 10 sessions, avgScore ≥ 0.85 + goodRuns ≥ 3 + completionRate ≥ 0.80 for Strong; avgScore ≥ 0.70 + goodRuns ≥ 2 for Comfortable; else Exploring; no sessions = Not Ready), explicit non-goals (no AI, no gate, no child UI, no level tree), phase status section updated to mark Phase D shipped and describe Phase D+ scope.
- `docs/research/observation/play-observation-system.md` — Peer Comparison section updated: marked as ✅ done (replaced in Phase D).
- `docs/research/missions/mission-system.md` — **Subject Readiness and Mission Design** section added: explains why highest unlocked level is unreliable, defines mission content weighting from readiness profile, example profiles (Thai Strong / Math Comfortable / English Exploring → Thai 60% / Math 30% / English 10%), when to apply per mission phase, core principle "Mission should follow the child."
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — Subject Readiness Decisions section added: 9 decisions covering derivation, mission weighting, Shop Stretch independence, Cooking Mission dependency, implementation timing.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — Phase D+ Subject Readiness documentation marked done; Cooking Mission task updated with readiness dependency warning; Subject Readiness Report display added as deferred task.
- No app code changed.

- `src/games/GamePhonics.jsx` — `useRef` import added; `sessionStart` refs added to all 4 game components (PhonicsGame, CVCGame, SightGame, SentenceGame); `LOG_SESSION` dispatched in each `next()` when done; replay resets refs.
- `src/components/Report.jsx` — `MissionAnalytics` component added (runs, avg score, avg duration, hints, phase difficulty table, replay framing, deterministic nudge); peer-comparison card replaced with play-history timeline (last 10 sessions).
- Build: ✅ zero errors.

## 2026-06-03 — Workflow Audit + Architecture Language Patch (docs only)

- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — fixed two present-tense statements that implied `MissionScreen.jsx` + `missionConfig.js` are current architecture. Both are future targets (after 2+ missions). Current routing clarified: Home → `GameScreen.jsx` → `GameShop.jsx` (world `'shop'`).

- No app code changed this session.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase D Wording Patch: Observation Language + Engagement Signals (docs only)

- `docs/research/observation/play-observation-system.md` — final wording improvements before implementation: `passed` → `completed`; `hardestPhase` → `challengePhase`; "most difficult phase" → "current challenge area"; `replayedImmediately` and `nextAction` added to session entry schema; new **Engagement Signals** section (explains why engagement signals outweigh scores, documents `replayedImmediately`, `nextAction`, replay count, and session duration); nudge rule updated to `runs === 1 && completed`; nudge condition updated to `challengePhaseAcc`; "pass/fail icon" in play history renamed to "completed/not completed".
- `docs/GPT_NOTES.md` — terminology decisions section added; engagement signal rationale recorded; D0 noted in Phase D scope.

- No app code changed.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase C: Shop Mission MVP

- `src/games/GameShop.jsx` — NEW: 4 phases / 6 questions (Phase 1: Thai matching ×3, Phase 2: English vocab ×1, Phase 3: counting ×1, Phase 4: social phrase ×1). 4 choices per question. Accepts both ขอบคุณครับ/ค่ะ for social phrase. XP dispatched per subject. Done screen with pass/fail at 80% threshold.
- `src/lib/state.js` — `shopV1: { bestScore, runs, mastered, stretchUnlocked }` added to `defaultState()`.
- `src/context/StateContext.jsx` — `UPDATE_SHOP_V1` action + reducer case: tracks bestScore, runs, mastered (≥90% + ≤1 wrong + ≥2 runs). stretchUnlocked always false for MVP.
- `src/games/GameScreen.jsx` — lazy-imports `GameShop`, adds `shop` world to `WORLD_TITLES`.
- `src/components/Home.jsx` — Missions section added above Egg Run. Shop card shows best score and run count after first play. Always unlocked.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase B+ Mastery-Gate Patch: mastery signal tightened, Stretch content confirmed
- `mission-system.md`: Mastery signal simplified to 3 hard criteria — accuracy ≥ 90%, ≤ 1 wrong, ≥ 2 runs. Removed "hint dependency" from hard criteria (not tracked yet; can be added later). Speed re-clarified as optional context only, never a gate.
- `shop-mission.md`: Shop Stretch section updated with explicit unlock trigger listing the 3 criteria. "Why 4 steps" section rewritten — quantity difference and price concept named as Stretch, Core MVP steps stated inline.
- `GPT_NOTES.md`: Product Decisions — mastery signal now 3 explicit criteria; Shop Core/Stretch split named explicitly.
- `TASKS.md`: Mastery signal note updated — speed NOT required.
- No app code changed.

- `mission-system.md`: Unlock threshold 70% → 80% (aligned with subject levels; 70% guessable on 4 questions). Engine philosophy updated: start with `GameShop.jsx`, delay generic `MissionScreen.jsx` until pattern validated.
- `GPT_NOTES.md`: Architecture suggestions updated to staged approach; threshold and step count corrected.
- `TASKS.md`: Now task updated — 4-step MVP, GameShop.jsx first, no missionConfig/MissionScreen yet.
- No app code changed.

## 2026-06-03 — Mission System Design Review & Patch
- Confirmed existing mission docs (README, mission-system, shop, cooking, garden) are complete.
- Added "Explicit Non-Goals" section to `mission-system.md`: no payment, no multiplayer, no social features, no Grade 2+, no AI tutor, no unique mini-games.
- No other changes needed — TASKS, GPT_NOTES, RESEARCH_INDEX already up to date.

## 2026-06-03 — Mission System Design (documentation only)
- Created `docs/research/missions/` with 5 files: README, mission-system, shop-mission, cooking-mission, garden-mission.

- `GameMath.jsx`: `genQ` numeric branch now attaches `visualModel`, `emojiA`, `emojiB` to question object.
- New `VisualModel` component with 4 modes:
  - `objects`: real emoji grid (emojiA×a + emojiB×b) with `+` separator; smaller font when total > 10.
  - `tenFrame`: 2×5 or 4×5 coloured grid (amber=a, blue=b, grey=empty); fallback dots if total > 20.
  - `crossOut`: emoji grid with ❌ overlay on the last `b` items (subtraction visualisation).
  - `null` (L5+): unchanged coloured 🟡/🔵 dots.

## 2026-06-03 — Math Content Expansion + New Question Types
- `MATH_WORDS` expanded from 16 → 30: added joining, taking-away, and 10 comparison problems (`comparison:true`).
